mturk_agent_2,Hey! I'd like some more firewood to keep my doggo warm. What do you need?,0,0
mturk_agent_1,"I need firewood as well. We have a large group consisting of mostly senior citizens, including my grandma, so we'd like the firewood to keep everyone warm.",0,1
mturk_agent_2,I see. 😮 What are you least interested in?,0,1
mturk_agent_1,We can make do without extra water. Can we trade two waters for an extra firewood package and an extra food package?,0,2
mturk_agent_2,We could do without the water as well. I'm willing to trade you 3 firewood for 3 food and 2 waters,0,2
mturk_agent_1,"We need some firewood too, though! ☹️ Let's try to make a deal that benefits us both! 🙂 Could I have 1 firewood, 3 food, and 3 waters?",0,3
mturk_agent_2,"I meant I would give you my firewood, what would you trade in return?",0,3
mturk_agent_1,"Oh sorry for the confusion. 😮 In that case, thank you for the generosity! 🙂 How about if I have 3 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water?",0,4
mturk_agent_2,I can do that for 3 food and 3 water?,0,4
mturk_agent_1,"I think we're close. Let's shake hands on this: 3 firewood, 1 food for me, and then 2 food and 3 water for you. I'll make sure your food packages have extra doggy treats! 🙂 Is that a deal?",0,5

mturk_agent_2,Hello. How are you?,1,0
mturk_agent_1,I am good. I am pretty excited for the trip this weekend. what about you?,1,0
mturk_agent_2,Very excited. It will be fun.,1,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, Hopefully the weather holds up. So I was thinking, i am bringning my two kids along with me, and they will need food, so I was thinking i could take the three foods, and either one of the firewood or water, up to you.",1,1
mturk_agent_2,I would also like a little extra food for my kids. Maybe we can split it somehow?,1,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I am willing to give you one food, in exchange for two firewoods, that would mean you get 3 waters, 1 food and 1 firewood. you get 5 items, while i get 4.",1,2
mturk_agent_2,"If I only get 1 food, than I would like 2 firewood. So you get 2 food, 1 firewood, and 1 water.",1,3
mturk_agent_1,"No i do not need water, as i am camping near a potable stream. I would like 2 firewood. It is only fair that i get two firewood, since you are getting more supplies (5), i think i should be able to choose what 4 i should get.",1,3
mturk_agent_2,"No, if you get 2 food, it's only fair that I get 2 firewood. ",1,4
mturk_agent_1,"Then i will take 3 waters, and 2 food.",1,4
mturk_agent_2,Okay I will take all the firewood and 1 food.,1,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,1,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,1,6
mturk_agent_2,hello!,10,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello.,10,0
mturk_agent_2,Can i kindly know your preferences please?,10,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I'm kind of low on water, so I'd like to get as much of that as I can. I'd like to go hiking and I don't really have enough water for a long trip. What about you?",10,1
mturk_agent_2,Ohh nice.I also have the same issue around here.The thirst for water is growing high than ever due to drought,10,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, that's a bummer. How are you set for food? While I wouldn't mind a bit more, I'm in pretty good shape there, so I'd be willing to trade it for water. I'd hate to leave without getting a good hike in.",10,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hun,It's a bit of a fair deal,but due to the condition here i will need a bit more of water though foo cannot be overlooked also for survival but still to survive we take chances.So do you mind me giving you a package of food and u trading 2 pakages of water?.",10,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I tell you what, I'd be willing to take 2 packages of water and 2 of firewood and leave the rest to you, including all of the food. How does that sound?🙂",10,3
mturk_agent_2,ok nice good deal,10,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well, alright, then, I think we have a deal, nice and easy. It was a pleasure doing business with you.",10,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,10,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,10,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there, good to connect with you. How are you today?",100,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am good, thank you.  What are your preferences? I really need the extra food packages.  We are doing a lot of hiking and mountain biking and there are no grocery stores for at least 50 miles.🙂",100,0
mturk_agent_1,Oh wow that is quite a lot of hiking! I think we will be hanging out a lot overnight and so I am looking for more firewood if possible. My kids can't hike very far and want to do more with smores and marshmellows. ,100,1
mturk_agent_2,"I can work with that.  I am willing to give you all of the firewood.  We are in a hot climate and won't need too much.  Being in a hot climate and with a lot of exercise, I am hoping to take the three water packages. ",100,1
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you for that. I'm happy to give you the food packages as well as we shouldn't need extras. Being around the fire, we are going to be hot as well and dehydrated. I say let's try and split the waters. ",100,2
mturk_agent_2,We are going to be in an area where there is little potable water.  I don't have a water filter either.  The extra water will be very important for our group.  ,100,2
mturk_agent_1,I understand. We will have a big group (about 10 people) so we are trying to have as much water as possible as well. If anyone gets dehydrated it'd be the end of the trip and hard to get everyone back to base. What's the fewest amount of bottles you're willing to accept?,100,3
mturk_agent_2,"😮Two packages is the lowest I would accept.  There is one exception to that.  If you were willing to give up 2 firewood, then I would be willing to take 1 water.  I think I could trade some extra firewood for water at the campsite.",100,3
mturk_agent_1,"I understand. I am not willing to give up any firewood, but I'd be willing to do a trade of 1 food for 1 water. So 3 firewood for us, 1 water for us, and 1 food for us.  ",100,4
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, that won't work for me. ☹️ My counteroffer is I will take three waters and two food packages and give you all of the firewood and 1 food.  I am running out of time, and if we don't agree, we will both lose out, so please consider this last offer.🙂",100,4
mturk_agent_1,Okay I can live with that. ,100,5

mturk_agent_1,"Same, just getting ready for my families camping trip. Ready to make memories in the desert. Do you have any preferences for the items?",1000,1
mturk_agent_2,"That's nice, I am camping with the wife. Well I am camping near a stream so I don't need much water.",1000,2
mturk_agent_1,"That works for us, we will need a ton of water being in the desert and having a family of 5. We will not need much firewood if you want that you can have it.",1000,2
mturk_agent_2,"I need more food than anything, but probably some firewood too as I'll need to cook it.",1000,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about I take 3 water, 1 food and 1 firewood? How does that sound?",1000,3
mturk_agent_2,How about you take 3 water and I take 3 food and  we negotiate more on the firewood?,1000,4
mturk_agent_1,Sure. I only need one firewood. Does that work?,1000,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hello! How are you? We're on a camping trip, but we ran into some stranded hikers and shared some of our supplies with them, so we're hoping to get some more to cover what we lost. ☹️",1001,0
mturk_agent_1,😮 Oh no. How long were they stranded? I hope I can help you out.,1001,0
mturk_agent_2,"They were hiking down from their camp site and got stranded in a storm. They were taking shelter in a cave and said they had been there for about an extra day. If you could help, we'd really appreciate it!",1001,1
mturk_agent_1,What would you need to get you by?,1001,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, we mostly shared a lot of food with them as well as some water, although they were already able to collect some to drink from the rain. At least they didn't need any of our firewood.",1001,2
mturk_agent_1,I can give you 1 food. 2 Water and 2 firewood ,1001,2
mturk_agent_2,I think we'll definitely need more food than that. We still have our whole 4 day camping trip ahead of us and we've lost half our supply of food. Would it be possible to get 2 food 2 water and 1 firewood?,1001,3
mturk_agent_1,I heard there are a lot of bears up on the ridge where we plan on going that like to steal the food. I really want to keep it in more than one location just in case. We have plenty of water though. I can do 1 food 3 water and 2 firewood.,1001,3
mturk_agent_2,"Oh wow, that sounds pretty dangerous. I understand why you need the food now. Since we wouldn't have to hike an hour to the stream to get water, we'll probably be less hungry then. So I'll get 1 food, 3 water, and 2 firewood, ok?",1001,4
mturk_agent_1,Great 🙂. That sounds good. I'm glad I could help.,1001,4

mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I am fine with you taking 3 waters if you are ok with me taking 3 firewood",1004,2

mturk_agent_1,I have a large party and need to make sure we don't run out ,1004,3

mturk_agent_1,Yes! I can't wait to get out of town. I'm mostly packed. You?,1006,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I am.  Just a few last minute errands and we will be ready to go.  Who is joining you on your trip or are you going solo?",1006,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, it was going to be a solo trip, but at the last minute my friend asked if he could join. I want to say yes but I don't think I have enough food for another person. When we split up supplies, how about I take all of the food and half the firewood, and you take the water and the rest of the firewood?",1006,1
mturk_agent_2,How about I take 3 firewoods and 2 waters and you can have all the food? ,1006,2
mturk_agent_1,"Hm, that doesn't work for me. I get really cold, so I'm looking forward to building a big fire. How about I take all the food, 1 firewood, and 1 water, and you take 2 firewoods and 2 waters?",1006,2
mturk_agent_2,I agree a fire at night is really nice. I think this deal is pretty good. I think we have food covered as my sons went to the store today and picked up all of their favorite snacks.  Not sure it's all going to fit in my car. LOL,1006,3
mturk_agent_1,Nice! I'll tell my friend he can join - he'll be so excited 🙂,1006,3
mturk_agent_2,I think it is always a good idea to go with someone else not only for companionship but also for safety.  Are  you planning on hiking? I heard it is beautiful this time of year. ,1006,4
mturk_agent_1,"That's a good point about safety. Yes, I'm going to do some day hikes. How about you and your boys?",1006,4

mturk_agent_2,I think we'll be OK with the food we have. They're really not big eaters.  A couple of them always seem to be cold so some more firewood would be great.,1007,1
mturk_agent_1,"We could help with that I’m sure. What about 3 food for me, 3 water for you, and 2 firewood for you with just 1 for me?",1007,1
mturk_agent_2,That would be great. Very nice of you.🙂,1007,2
mturk_agent_1,Great some have a deal. Are you looking forward to camping?,1007,2

mturk_agent_2,I understand but that would mean you get everything and i get nothing. How is that fair? ☹️,1008,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's true. Can I get 3 food, 2 water? And you can have 2 firewood?",1008,1
mturk_agent_2,I like to have a nice cup of tea at night before I go to bed to help me relax and sleep. I also need food to eat. You never know if you are going to get stranded and so I would like some extra food,1008,2
mturk_agent_1,"Absolutely, that sounds like a real concern. How about we do 2 for 1? I just am really concerned for my kids, I have so many people accompanying me on this trip.",1008,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok I am willing to make it so we both win and have a great time.  I guess since you are having more people it would make sense to need more food. ,1008,3
mturk_agent_1,"I agree, and I really appreciate it. So 2-1 straight down? I'll submit the deal.",1008,3
mturk_agent_2,Sure only so your kids can have a great time and its just me going camping. ,1008,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello! 🙂 I would like to start off the offer with you can have 1 water and ALL 3 firewood. 😮,1009,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there. What about the food? I am bringing teenagers with me, so I was hoping to have all three food and at least two water.",1009,0
mturk_agent_2,"😮 Ill need at least two food, I am a diabetic and food and water are essential to keep my blood sugar within a range that I will be able to function, without it my mental status changes, and unless those teens want to see an interestingggg show I need food and water",1009,1
mturk_agent_1,Understood. How many people will be with you?,1009,1
mturk_agent_2,"We are a family of 3, and have 2 dogs, the dogs will not require food from this package, but will need someof the water",1009,2
mturk_agent_1,We are also a family of 3 🙂. But my son is bringing three friends. Have you ever fed four teenage boys? 😮 Lord help me! That is why I was hoping to have more food.,1009,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can't even imagine! What if we do you can have two food, 1 water and since I have the dogs that love to run and play, Ill take 1 food and 2 water",1009,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds great! How would you like to split the firewood? My son loves to build campfires.,1009,3
mturk_agent_2,"With taking less food my sugar will be low, in that state I will be very cold. My wife knows when my sugar is dropping just based on how many blankets I need, even in the summer haha! ",1009,4
mturk_agent_1,Would you like all three then? My son and his friends can gather sticks and broken pieces in the woods.,1009,4

mturk_agent_1,Hi! What sort of packages are you looking for today?,101,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there! I am looking to have 3 packages of firewood, 2 packages of food, and 1 package of water please. ",101,0
mturk_agent_1,"Oh we have similar priorities 🙂I am also interested in getting firewood, because I have a condition that makes me very cold, colder than the average person, so I need to make sure I have enough for the trip. Why do you want food",101,1
mturk_agent_2,That make sense. I need firewood though too because I have an autoimmune disease. When it flares up - when it gets too cold - I get very sick and have to go to the hospital. I need to make sure I have enough for the trip as well. I need food to keep my metabolism up so I can make sure my disease stays in check. Why do you want food?,101,1
mturk_agent_1,"That makes sense . I have a friend coming with me on the camping trip, and she also needs to eat, so I'd like to get an extra package of food if possible. ",101,2
mturk_agent_2,"Okay that would be fine. If I can have 3 packages of firewood, you can have 2 packages of food. Does that work?",101,2
mturk_agent_1,"That does not work for me. I need at least one package of firewood. I'm sure you understand, because it seems like we have medical conditions with similar effects. You can take all of the water if I can get 2 packages of food and 1 of firewood. Does that work?",101,3
mturk_agent_2,I do understand. That will work for me. ,101,3
mturk_agent_1,Could you tell me about why you want water? ,101,4
mturk_agent_2,I want water so I can keep hydrated during this camping trip. It's important for me to drink bottled water vs. getting water out at camping as it may flare up my disease. ,101,4
mturk_agent_1,"Oh interesting! I have a device that allows me to drink pond/stream water by cleaning it, so water isn't as important to me.",101,5

mturk_agent_1,Same here!  I didn't realize that I would have a neighbor so close,1010,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well, hopefully since we are close neighbors we can work out an agreement that helps us both, right?",1010,1
mturk_agent_1,yup!  I am a master chef.  I think that if we pool our resources everything will be great for both of us,1010,1
mturk_agent_2,"That would be great! Since you are a master chef, you can probably make something out of nothing like a true pro! Unfortunately, I am a diabetic and if I don't eat regularly my blood sugar drops and I get really dizzy and could even pass out. I would be much more comfortable knowing the 3 food packs were with me so they are close if I need them. Is that okay with you?",1010,2
mturk_agent_1,Yes.  I have no problem with that.  Keep your firewood over at my site and just tell me when you need something made.  That way you don't need to worry about cooking while your sugar is low,1010,2
mturk_agent_2,"Wow, that would be so kind of you 🙂 You can take the 3 firewood and I will take the 3 food. Are you okay with me taking the water as well?",1010,3
mturk_agent_1,"leave me with one so that the kids have easy access to water.  wood with me, food with you, and 1 water with me",1010,3
mturk_agent_2,"That works for me. 3 firewood and 1 water to you, 3 food and 2 water for me. We make pretty great neighbors ;)",1010,4

mturk_agent_1,Well it is by fresh water so I would say water is the lowest. But I am not sure about what would is there so firewood? What about you?,1011,2
mturk_agent_2,"I agree that lake michigan and winnebago has access to water to boil, fish to catch, and I think firewood to chop. I would say that for the camping trip food would be the highest want followed by firewood and finally water",1011,3
mturk_agent_1,I can understand that. I went on a winter trip that was like that. So how would you like to trade items?,1011,3
mturk_agent_2,Would you be interested in trade 2 Water for 1 Firewood and 2 Firewood for 1 Food?,1011,4

mturk_agent_1,I am super pumped! My main worry is water because of the size of our group. Really need the extra packages for cooking etc,1016,0
mturk_agent_2,"That is exactly our need! How many are you thinking you need? by the way, food is not as much as a priority for my group. ",1016,1
mturk_agent_1,umm. I was thinking atleast 2. Food is not a big priority for us either as we can always fish ,1016,1
mturk_agent_2,"Are you okay with receiving 2 waters, 1 firrewood, and 2 food? And, don't forget the bait!🙂",1016,2
mturk_agent_1,"So you are offering me 2 waters, 1 fire and 2 food? is that correct",1016,2
mturk_agent_2,Exactly. Does that sound okay to you guys? How many are in your group?,1016,3

mturk_agent_1,So do you want to get 3 packages of food for the camping?,1017,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes please, and then I also need to get 3 packages of water because I am allergic to the lake and will need to bathe using the water we bring.",1017,1
mturk_agent_1,Sure that's great! So you are getting everything ?,1017,2
mturk_agent_2,I need to talk it out more with you.  There is also an issue with the firewood.,1017,2

mturk_agent_1,"I can understand that, but I would also like to have more firewood because I am anemic. I get cold very, very easily, even in the daytime. ☹️",1018,1
mturk_agent_2,What about food? I don't need a lot since I ate alot yesterday.,1018,2
mturk_agent_1,How would you feel about me taking 3 firewood and 2 water and you taking 1 water and 3 food?,1018,2
mturk_agent_2,I don't need that much food though. I'm more worried about having water since there's no streams around.,1018,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, that is a good point. How about I take 3 firewood, 1 water, 1 food, and you take 2 water and 2 food?",1018,3
mturk_agent_2,I think I'll need at least 1 firewood. How about I get 1 firewood 2 water and 1 food? Leaving you 2 firewood 1 water and 2 food.,1018,4

mturk_agent_2,Sounds like a good deal. I just need 1 firewood to make camp fire. Which item do you prefer the least?,1019,2
mturk_agent_1,I am least concerned about food.,1019,3
mturk_agent_2,So can I get 2 then? 🙂,1019,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sure. So you will take 2 water, 2 food, and 1 firewood?",1019,4

mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I'm really looking forward to you and so is my family who is traveling with me.",1020,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, nice. 🙂 Family vacations are always a nice way to spend some quality time together.",1020,2
mturk_agent_1,"Since I'm traveling with family members in the summer heat, I would like to have more water for us to stay hydrated. We have non-persihable food stored at our camp site so we don't need to bring additional food but water and some firewood are important to avoid running out of water or the means to boil water from a stream if needed.",1020,2
mturk_agent_2,"Okay. I am in need of additional food as I am a diabetic. Water isnt really a priority to me. However, some extra firewood to stay warm at night would be appreciated.",1020,3
mturk_agent_1,How about you take all the food packages and 1 water and 1 firewood? ,1020,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds agreeable. I would gladly accept this offer. 🙂,1020,4
mturk_agent_1,"Great, that would work well for us, too. I wouldn't want you to be short on needed food or carbs or cold at night. I hope you have a great trip.",1020,4

mturk_agent_2,Would you mind sharing your preferences for what packages you care the most about with me?  That way we can decide how best to split them 🙂,1021,1
mturk_agent_1,"I need food the most, while water is the least needed item in my list",1021,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, actually I am the same, which is a bit unfortunate.  I guess what would make sense is for one of us to get 2 foods and 1 firewood and one of us to get 1 food and 2 firewoods",1021,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, that seems fair",1021,2
mturk_agent_2,And then whoever took the 1 food and 2 firewoods should probably get 2 waters as well to make up for getting fewer of our top priorities,1021,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay!,1021,3
mturk_agent_2,Sounds great.  Sounds like we've basically arrived at a deal 🙂,1021,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I was planning to go to the river. How about yourself?",1023,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm going to be exploring the area around the site. I haven't been here before so it will be novel. What do you think the weather will be like?,1023,1
mturk_agent_2,"The weather is suppose to be very hot, that is why I am in need of the water ",1023,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah I can understand that. I also need water, but since I'm going to be moving around a lot, food is my highest concern. It sounds like neither one of us will be too concerned about firewood.",1023,2
mturk_agent_2,"I am wanting to build a fire, to be able to cook on. Since I will be on the river, I will have some water. What about If I had 2 of the firewood and the food. What if you have all the water and one food?",1023,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I'm glad you plan to build a fire! I don't, so I'd be willing to let you have all 3 firewood. I need some of the food as well. How about you take all 3 firewood, and I get 2 food and 3 water (you will have extra water, after all)?",1023,3
mturk_agent_2,"That is true. I would need some food, since I will not have any water. What if I have the 3 firewood and 2 food. That way you have the water so you will not be parched and you will have a food as well. ",1023,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think we're close to an agreement here! 🙂 Given that I plan to be very active, I'd still like to keep 2 of the food if I can. If I give up one water (who knows what you'll need, and the river won't be for drinking!), could we do a deal where I get 2 food and 2 water and you get all 3 firewood and 1 food and 1 water? Maybe you could catch some fish (if I do, I could share)?",1023,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello! 🙂 I'm in desperate need of firewood. Tell me - what do you need?,1024,0
mturk_agent_1,I feel so excited about this camping trip. I will be going with my little ones and I would also need the firewood to keep them warm. How do we share the packages. I need more firewood and food. You can take the water,1024,0
mturk_agent_2,It's a good thing we already have firewood already! But I can imagine that keeping the little ones warm is a hard task. I'm in need of firewood because we got caught in a storm and our clothes are soaking wet. Would you accept 1 firewood and 2 food?,1024,1
mturk_agent_1,I actually need the extra firewood. Remember kids are more susceptible to cold. They need it to stay warm when it's cold. ,1024,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm aware that kids need to stay warm when it's cold. Do you know how cold it is when all your clothes are soaking wet from the rain? I'm sure you can spare at least one firewood so we can dry off. ,1024,2
mturk_agent_1,"If that's the case then, let me have 2 firewood, you can keep the water. I need more food for my kids as well. You know how much kids eat. ",1024,2
mturk_agent_2,"Kids definitely eat a lot. I'm sure kids also love S'mores. If you give me one food as well, I'll be more than happy to invite you and the kids to the S'mores party we're having later on! 🙂",1024,3
mturk_agent_1,Wow... That's interesting. I will definitely bring them to the party. ,1024,3
mturk_agent_2,"Great! 🙂 I'll be happy to see you all there. To confirm, I'm giving you 2 firewood and 2 food, and I'll give 1 firewood, 1 food, and all the waters?",1024,4
mturk_agent_1,Yeah. It looks great. But it would be nice of you to share at least 1 water with me. That would be generous of you and my kids will appreciate your kind gesture. ,1024,4
mturk_agent_2,"Of course, I'll be more than happy to spare one water for the kids.",1024,5

mturk_agent_1,"I think your friends are adults. I have my children as well. In this case,  can understand your situation. I will share 2 food pack with you but I need 3 pack of water. Please consider🙂",1025,1
mturk_agent_2,I have plenty of food. I don't need any of it. We are going to have extra.  we really need the water. They forgot to stop at the store before they left and now they are like 10 mins away. I can give 3 food for you and your kids. ,1025,1
mturk_agent_1,I'll accept the food from you but I need at least 1 pack of water.Because water is very essential. We do not have sufficient water.Kindly share water with me.,1025,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok I will give you 1 pack of water 1 firewood and 3 foods. 🙂 How does that sounds?,1025,2
mturk_agent_1,"You are so understandable🙂.  I know we both need water in a high amount. I'll accept the water pack. In a trip, we need firewood for night. Can you share 2 firewood.?",1025,3
mturk_agent_2,That is not very fair to me at. I'm trying to be fair to both of us. ,1025,3
mturk_agent_1,☹️ I can understand but I need firewood. You take 1 pack of food. Instead of 3 pack of food I will take 2 food and share 2 firewood.,1025,4
mturk_agent_2,No way that is not fair at all.😡  You can get 2 waters 1 firewood and one food. That is fair and works out better for you.,1025,4

mturk_agent_2,"Food is most important to me. I am considering doing some extra hiking if I have the energy, i.e. calories, available. ",1026,2
mturk_agent_1,"OK, I am really looking for firewood as it has been very cold out and I am hunting for some food also.",1026,2
mturk_agent_2,Would you be okay if I took 2 out of the 3 packages of food?  We can give you more firewood to compensate. ,1026,3
mturk_agent_1,How is your water situation? There is a lot of fresh water around so I can part with a lot of my supply.,1026,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'll be happy to take whatever you can spare, but it is not a priority of mine, given the local supply you mentioned.  ",1026,4
mturk_agent_1,How much firewood is available. I would prefer 3 packages if I am giving up 2 food packages.,1026,4
mturk_agent_2,Could you possibly leave me with one package of firewood?  I might want to stay up late and sing songs around the fire.  ,1026,5
mturk_agent_1,I would give you all the water if I could have all firewood. I would keep 1 food and give you two.,1026,5
mturk_agent_2,"Alright, I think that sounds pretty fair.  All our needs would be met.  ",1026,6
mturk_agent_1,You can cut down some trees for your fire haha.,1026,6

mturk_agent_2,"Awesome, I'm going to have a larger group with me, I would really appreciate getting the extra food, you are welcome to any amount of the wood and water.",1027,1
mturk_agent_1,I'd be willing to give you all three food in exchange for what I need. I need water and firewood. I'll be camping in the desert and there's no water supply and it gets quite cold at night!,1027,1
mturk_agent_2,"Great, I would need a little extra water though for a larger group. Would 3 food, no wood and 1 water for me work for you?",1027,2
mturk_agent_1,Hmm. I'd be more willing to give up some firewood than water. Would you take 1 firewood instead?,1027,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, I could do that. So 3 food, 1 fire and 0 water for me, the rest for you.🙂",1027,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me!,1027,3
mturk_agent_2,"great, looks like we are all set, enjoy your trip!",1027,4
mturk_agent_1,You too! I'm glad we were able to make a deal,1027,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,1027,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,1027,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi. I am pretty excited to take my son and his friends camping. They have so much energy,1028,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, I am also going camping but I am taking my 3 kids 🙂",1028,0
mturk_agent_1,Between us we have our hands full.🙂 So I am hoping to be able to score 3 food units and 2 waters. What are your needs?,1028,1
mturk_agent_2,I can work with that but is there any way I can get 2 waters instead of just 1? There's nowhere to shower here,1028,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh sure! I am okay with a jump in the river if it is not too cold! I need at least one firewood because I love to sew before bed but I need the light!,1028,2
mturk_agent_2,That is fine. I can give up 1 firewood. Any way I can get 1 food?,1028,2
mturk_agent_1,We really do need food because teens.🙂🙂 But how about I give you 1 food and 1 firewood? Oh. That's what you just said! Great minds think alike.,1028,3
mturk_agent_2,I'll just take 2 firewood 2 water if that's OK,1028,3
mturk_agent_1,"Oh well, I guess so. ☹️ I will probably fall asleep early anyway. 🙂 When are you leaving for your camp adventure?",1028,4
mturk_agent_2,In about 30 minutes actually. Gotta get going so we can get there before noon,1028,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,1028,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,1028,5
mturk_agent_2,"I think I need more water because I take medicine and it gives me dry mouth. So I think I should have 2 more waters, 2 more food packages and 2 more firewoods. I'm not the best at camping. And I need all the help I can get.",1029,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! I totally get it. But, since my nephew will be joinging me on this trip, I won't be able to spar that much.",1029,0
mturk_agent_2,"I completely understand. But since you're taking your nephew, you must be confident in this camping trip. Whereas I am not. I'm new to this. So I really do need those supplies. I don't know how to hunt or fish. I'm sure you'll understand.",1029,1
mturk_agent_1,I am a bit used to camping and that is why i prefer to bring extra food for two. Just in case the wildlife there isn't abudant.,1029,1
mturk_agent_2,That's a good idea. 🙂 So since you already have extra I think my offer is pretty good.,1029,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, how about this. You get 3 firewood, 2 water. I get alll food, 1 water?",1029,2
mturk_agent_2,"That actually sounds pretty good all but the water. I need that extra water. So how about I agree to 2 firewoods, I''ll take you up on all the food since that may be a problem for me but I still need all of the waters.",1029,3
mturk_agent_1,Thats sound fine,1029,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok. Great.🙂 So just to verify I'll have 3 waters, 2 firewoods and 3 food packages. ",1029,4
mturk_agent_1,Nope. I get the 3 food items.,1029,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes that's right. sorry about that. you get 3 foods and 1 firewood. and i get 3 waters and 2 firewoods. ,1029,5
mturk_agent_1,"Yep, that's it.",1029,5
mturk_agent_2,Glad that's settled. Hope you all have a good trip. ,1029,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,1029,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,1029,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there.. we're looking forward to this camping trip.. hope you are, too!  Is there anything in particular you guys need / want out of the extra stockpile we've got?",103,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! Which item do you need the most?,103,0
mturk_agent_1,"Well we actually really NEED all three items.. but I know you might, too - so I want to make a deal that's fair for you.. is there anything in particular your family needs for the trip?",103,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, there has to be an item that you need the most. If you tell me what you need the most, we can try to make a deal around it.",103,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh I see, its going to be THAT kind of negotiation 🙂  Let's just look at it this way.. I'm with a couple other Floridians so we're not really too worried about firewood as we prefer it cooler, anyway.. and we know the lake is nearby that's stocked with trout for eating if necessary (and of course some fresh water's there, too) - so.. I can tell you that I could go totally without Firewood if I needed to.. I'd rather not, but I could.",103,2
mturk_agent_2,Do you prefer food or water more?,103,2
mturk_agent_1,"Since the lake is nearby enough, I think we'd be more interested in ensuring there's enough food for my people, I think 🙂",103,3
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm. I really need food too. I don't care much for water either. How about I take all 3 firewood, 2 food, and 1 water?",103,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, that's not going to work for me.. I can give you two food if you really need it, but in exchange I'm going to need two of the water and all the firewood.  ",103,4
mturk_agent_2,"I will just take 3 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water. That work for you?",103,4
mturk_agent_1,"Tell you what.. now that I think about it.. you seem like you really need the firewood.. no problem.  I want you to have all 3 of them.. and you can have 1 water and 1 food, too.. does that work for you?  That would just leave me 2 food, 2 water, and no firewood.",103,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,103,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,103,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello how are you today? 🙂 Do you have any initial ideas on how to split everything? ,104,0
mturk_agent_2,I was thinking maybe I could have a majority of the fire food and you can have a majority of the water and food. ,104,0
mturk_agent_1,What exactly do you mean by majority? As in everything ?,104,1
mturk_agent_2,"I was more thinking 2 Firewood for me , 1 food and 1 water? The rest would be yours.",104,1
mturk_agent_1,"That is a promising bargain but I want at least 2 firewood, it makes for a fun time for my group.",104,2
mturk_agent_2,"Interesting , because my group feels the same way though. How does your group feel about water though?",104,2
mturk_agent_1,Water is not that important for us but the firewood is a deal breaker for us ☹️,104,3
mturk_agent_2,I see.... Well we really would like the firewood too though. Could you reconsider it makes a big difference for us.,104,3
mturk_agent_1,Sorry I will only consider a deal if I can get at least two fire wood.,104,4
mturk_agent_2,Well if that is the case then I want 1 Firewood 3 waters and 2 Food then. ,104,4
mturk_agent_1,That is kind of excessive though.... 6 - 3 of an item share? ,104,5
mturk_agent_2,Well you wanted the firewood so take it or leave it.,104,5
mturk_agent_1,"Can we do 5 - 4? and 2 fire wood , 1 food and 1 water for me?",104,6
mturk_agent_2,No😡,104,6
mturk_agent_1,Please its really unfair... The items are still in your favor. My family really needs the firewood and some additional water and food would make our day so much better. You are still coming out on top with excess supplies.,104,7
mturk_agent_2,"I guess, I can do that deal...",104,7
mturk_agent_1,Thank you so much! 🙂,104,8
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,104,8
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,104,9
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I want to keep 3 packages of the water and 2 packages of the food and 1 package of the fire wood , and you can keep 1 package of the food and 2 packages of the firewood.",105,0
mturk_agent_1,"Could I get 1 package of the water just to be entirely safe?? I really appreciate the 2 packages of firewood as it has been very wet and rainy where I will be going.  There will be a lot of standing water, so my chances for having safe water to drink might be a little iffy.",105,0
mturk_agent_2,Well I planned on spending a few extra days here at this camping site with my family so the extra water will really come in handy for me over the next few days.  I can offer you an extra package of firewood to keep the 3 packages of water.,105,1
mturk_agent_1,That makes total sense.  I will let you keep all 3 of the water packages.  If I take the extra firewood for all 3 packages then I can probably boil a lot of the water to get the harmful bacteria out.  I really appreciate your generosity 🙂.  ,105,1
mturk_agent_2,"No problem.🙂  So I will keep the 3 packages of water and, since I am giving you all 3 packages of the firewood I will take back the 1 food package and keep all 3 of the food packages.",105,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would still like at least 1 package of the food please.  There has been a lot of rain in the area, but I think some poisonous mushrooms maybe prevalent in the area, so to be extra cautious I would like a little spare food on hand.",105,2
mturk_agent_2,You don't have to eat the poison mushrooms. You can catch some fish from the river or hunt for small animals.  You have all of the firewood so cooking the food should not be a problem.,105,3
mturk_agent_1,"I won't willingly eat the poisonous mushrooms, but it could be very hard to tell the difference from safe and toxic ones.  I understand you will be staying in your area for a few extra days, but can you catch fish or hunt for small animals in your area too?",105,3
mturk_agent_2,I do not have any extra firewood to do so.☹️  So if I can keep 1 package of firewood so I hunt and cook the fish.  I will give you 1 package of the food.,105,4
mturk_agent_1,I would be willing to give up 1 package of the firewood to you for 1 package of the food.  ,105,4
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks🙂  I will give you 1 package of the food and 2 packages of the firewood, while I keep the rest of the supplies for my extended trip.",105,5

mturk_agent_1,Hi! How are you doing?,106,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm well! Excited for this camping trip.,106,0
mturk_agent_1,Same! I'm a little worried about some of my supplies though. What about you?,106,1
mturk_agent_2,Likewise! What are you most in need of?,106,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I'm camping up on a snowy mountain and I gave some of my food away to hikers who were passing me and were very tired and hungry, so I'd really like to get some more food. Firewood would be useful too, although I do have a thick coat and a sleeping bag. I plan on melting the snow to get water, so I don't think I'll need that too much. And you?",106,2
mturk_agent_2,"I have the same needs. I have a low metabolism, so I need food and firewood to keep me warm and energized. Water I plan on filtering elsewhere.",106,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, well, I'd like to help. How about if I take 2 food and 1 firewood and 2 water, and you can keep the rest?",106,3
mturk_agent_2,Would you mind if you got 3 food and 1 water and I got 3 firewood and 2 water?,106,3
mturk_agent_1,I'd like some firewood though... Would 3 food and 1 firewood for me work?,106,4
mturk_agent_2,"I would probably do that, yes",106,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,106,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,106,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello,107,0
mturk_agent_1,HI how are you today?,107,0
mturk_agent_2,Good. I am diabetic so would like to take 3 of the food,107,1
mturk_agent_1,"I would do that but our meat spoiled because the ice box was not properly closed. How about you get 2 of the meat, and I get 3 of the water?",107,1
mturk_agent_2,"ok I will just be able to get by with 2 of the food, I can give you all 3 of the water if I can take 2 of the wood. I have panic attacks in the dark.",107,2
mturk_agent_1,Okay that works for me as well.,107,2
mturk_agent_2,awesome any chance I could persuade you to substitute your 1 food item for an additional fire wood 🙂,107,3
mturk_agent_1,"No I cannot do that unfortunately. We brought just enough food for our weekend trip, and I cannot lose any or we will run out before our camping trip is over.",107,3
mturk_agent_2,"OK, just thought I'd ask, so are we settled on you getting 1 Food, 1 firewood and 3 waters?",107,4
mturk_agent_1,Yes that sounds like it will work for me.,107,4
mturk_agent_2,Great. Have a good day,107,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,107,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,107,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello,108,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi there!,108,0
mturk_agent_1,"Im really low in food, is it ok if I get 3 Food, 1 water & 1 firewood? What do you think?",108,1
mturk_agent_2,"With the cool weather in degrees lower than expected, my family of 7 are consuming firewood faster than expected. Thus, I would like all the firewood in exchange for the food",108,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh ok, that will be great. How about the water? Is 2 for me and 1 for you ok?",108,2
mturk_agent_2,How about 2 for me 🙂,108,2
mturk_agent_1,I have 3 kids with me who are always thirsty but we can negotiate for it,108,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok. Thats fine,108,3
mturk_agent_1,Oh great 🙂,108,4
mturk_agent_2,There is really not much option of evenness since its an odd number package.,108,4
mturk_agent_1,"I agree with you, thank you for understanding. But I think we had a great deal. Have a wonderful to you and your family. 🙂",108,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,108,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,108,6
mturk_agent_1,How many of each extra package are you thinking you need?,109,0
mturk_agent_2,"I would prefer to take all of the firewood, split the food, and you could have all of the water.  What do you need the most?",109,0
mturk_agent_1,"Splitting the food is what I was thinking as well, but I'd also like to split the firewood. We can split the water or I'm fine taking all of that.",109,1
mturk_agent_2,"I would be willing to take 2 firewood, 3 food, and 1 water if that would work for you.  ",109,1
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm I think I should take 2 food, 1 firewood, and 3 water. What do you think?",109,2
mturk_agent_2,Is your first priority the water?  I'm definitely willing to split up by what is most important to us both.,109,2
mturk_agent_1,Food is actually my first priority but since it seems to be first priority for us both I thought we could split that. Water doesn't seem to be a priority for you so thought I could take that,109,3
mturk_agent_2,My first priority is actually firewood.  Food is my second.  🙂,109,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay so would 2 firewood for you and 1 for me work, and 2 food for me and 1 for you?",109,4
mturk_agent_2,I can definitely agree to that.  What was your second preference?  Water was my third.,109,4
mturk_agent_1,firewood is my second preference and water is my third,109,5
mturk_agent_2,"Well, water doesn't benefit either of us much, so you can have two. So you will take 2 food, 1 firewood and 2 water?",109,5
mturk_agent_1,Yes that sounds good to me,109,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,109,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,109,7
mturk_agent_1,hi how are you are you ready for your trip,11,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm ready, I just would like to have a little extra stuff. How about you?",11,0
mturk_agent_1,yes I could use some extra food since i am hiking with my kids and they all have a friend that comes along...lol,11,1
mturk_agent_2,I know how that goes...We are planning on hiking too and we could also use some extra food.,11,1
mturk_agent_1,well I am sure between you and me we will find a way....,11,2
mturk_agent_2,"I really need some food, but I could also use extra firewood. It is supposed to be pretty cold at night and we would love to cook up some smores.",11,2
mturk_agent_1,I hear you we have the same issues well you can have either 2 food or 2 firewood what would you prefer?,11,3
mturk_agent_2,"I would prefer 2 food. I could give you 1 food, 2 firewood and 2 water?",11,3
mturk_agent_1,"that sounds like a good deal to me, ",11,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, that is great. Have fun!",11,4

mturk_agent_1,I am doing good. How about yourself?,110,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am great, i am really excited about going camping, how about you?",110,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, I want to make sure i am prepared. What do you think are the bests options?",110,1
mturk_agent_2,Well i would really like to have extra firewood since i am afraid of the dark and i don't need extra water so i was hoping you would want to trade that,110,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I think that sounds like a good option. I personally could use more food. I like to eat. ",110,2
mturk_agent_2,how do you propose we split the food then?,110,3
mturk_agent_1,Well I don't mind either way about the food. I'll recommend giving you 2 firewood 1 food and 1 water. ,110,3
mturk_agent_2,how about you get 3 waters and 2 foods? Does that work better?,110,4
mturk_agent_1,yes how much firewood. I need at least 1 to cook the food.,110,4
mturk_agent_2,"you should have enough firewood in the basic supplies to cook the food i think, with three waters and 2 foods you get 5 items and i get 4",110,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,110,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,110,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, what is your preference for supplies?  I would prefer to have as much extra firewood as possible, but am relatively indifferent to the rest.",111,0
mturk_agent_1,yes we have to supply more how much you want,111,0
mturk_agent_2,"I would like 3 firewood, and 2 food.  You can have 1 food and all of the water.",111,1
mturk_agent_1,oh okay I will send you what are the materials you have,111,1
mturk_agent_2,"I already have a good supply of fresh water from the lake I will be camping by, and can hunt for some food but not all.  What are you in need of?",111,2
mturk_agent_1,"oh that's great, what type of quality you have from us",111,2
mturk_agent_2,I have high quality water?  I'm not sure if I understand that question to be honest.,111,3
mturk_agent_1,"oh okay, you understand correctly, when you take the material from us",111,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, sounds good then.  I believe we have a deal then.",111,4
mturk_agent_1,"yes, we have a good deal. you want water from us",111,4
mturk_agent_2,"No, I want firewood and food.  No water.  I want 3 firewood and 2 food.",111,5
mturk_agent_1,"okay, that's great deal we can finalize a deal",111,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,111,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,111,6
mturk_agent_1,hello,112,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, there. Should we discuss how to divide up the items for the camping trip?",112,0
mturk_agent_1,"yeah. i need 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food",112,1
mturk_agent_2,I need to have 2 or 3 pieces of firewood because I did not pack any way to heat up my food without firewood.,112,1
mturk_agent_1,I also need 2 pieces of firewood,112,2
mturk_agent_2,"That's unfortunate. I cannot agree to a deal without 2 pieces of firewood. I would have to walk away, but that would bee worse for both of us.",112,2
mturk_agent_1,okay fine. will you give additional water?,112,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that would work out. ",112,3
mturk_agent_1,"because i have some firewood with myself. i required 1 firewood, 2 water and 1 food",112,4
mturk_agent_2,I would agree to this deal then.,112,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,112,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,112,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi! How is your camping trip going?,113,0
mturk_agent_1,"It's going good we could use some more supplies such as food and firewood, though.",113,0
mturk_agent_2,Same here haha. Is water your lowest priority item too?,113,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes. We think we have enough water for now.,113,1
mturk_agent_2,Same here! I am in need of food more than firewood however as I am very hungry. ,113,2
mturk_agent_1,Me too. We have a bigger family and we will run out of food if we don't get some more.,113,2
mturk_agent_2,"Since it looks like we have the same value ranking for our needs, how would you like to try to make the deal?",113,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well let's try to make this as fair as possible.🙂We could get 2 packages of food, leaving you with 2 extra packages of firewood as well as water.",113,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds great to me! So I will get 1 food, 2 firewood, and 2 water. That sounds very fair 🙂",113,4
mturk_agent_1,Yes. I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement so fast. This is great!🙂,113,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,113,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,113,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I'm in a strong need for food and water. Please let me have a few packages of food and water. I'd gladly trade all my firewood for it.",114,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello. Wow! That does not sound good. My sister just called and let me know she will be coming tonight. She is bringing food so i have plenty to share. 🙂,114,0
mturk_agent_2,That's some good news. 🙂 Are you sure she is going to be bringing food with her?,114,1
mturk_agent_1,Yea She is bring tons of food. So don't worry we have plenty of food to spare. 🙂 She did forget to get water. I didn't know she was coming so i didn't grab any and I forgot the 3 packages of water for myself at the store. ☹️,114,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yikes, that's not good. Water is very important, especially if you now have to take care of two people at your campsite now. I do have 3 packages of water but I don't think I can spare it all.",114,2
mturk_agent_1,I tell you what if we trade 3 food for 3 waters! I think that would be fair snice you said you need some food and snice I need some water. 🙂,114,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I do have some food but if I trade you all 3 packages of water, I won't have any at all. How about 2 packages of water, so we each have 1 package, including your sister?",114,3
mturk_agent_1,How about this it think it will work out better for us and you snice you need fire wood too. You get 3 food and 2 firewood and and I get 3 water and 1 firewood. 🙂🙂,114,3
mturk_agent_2,"I really don't want to be without water, how about 2 water and 2 firewood for the 3 packages of food?",114,4
mturk_agent_1,I just want to make sure I understand you I get 2 waters and 2 firewood and 0 food. ,114,4
mturk_agent_2,"That's right. Since you would be getting food from your sister, while I am camping alone, you would be getting more food pretty soon. ",114,5
mturk_agent_1,umm. I think the best and fair deal is a complete swap of water for food and you get 2 fire wood. ,114,5
mturk_agent_2,"Since the food can have some water and moisture in it, let's do 3 waters from me for your 3 food. How does that sound?",114,6
mturk_agent_1,That sounds very fair! I love it you will love these steaks. 🙂🙂,114,6
mturk_agent_2,Steaks sounds amazing. You defenteily have a deal then. Have fun camping and say hi to your sister for me. 🙂,114,7
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,114,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,114,8
mturk_agent_1,"Hi!  The weather is going to be a lot colder than I anticipated, so I need extra firewood.  Would you be willing to give some to me?",115,0
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, but I need 2 packs of firewood and 2 packs of food and water",115,0
mturk_agent_1,That doesn't really sound fair to me ☹️,115,1
mturk_agent_2,How much food do you need?,115,1
mturk_agent_1,I would like 1 or 2,115,2
mturk_agent_2,OK,115,2
mturk_agent_1,Could I have 2 firewood?,115,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok,115,3
mturk_agent_1,How are you with your water supply?,115,4
mturk_agent_2,I need one pack of water to survive and will boil water using the firewood.,115,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,115,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,115,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I'm exited to negotiate a deal with you today. How are you doing?,116,0
mturk_agent_2,I am doing well! Excited to be on this camping trip! I am glad we have all the basic supplies already.,116,0
mturk_agent_1,"Agreed! I am running low on firewood, unfortunately, which I need to cook food and stay warm. ",116,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh no! That's unfortunate! Luckily, I think I have plenty of Firewood for myself so I think it would be okay for you to have more of that if needed. I don't know if I have enough food. I love to snack all day!",116,1
mturk_agent_1,That's awesome! And oh no! I have a medium amount of food so we can work that out! How are you doing on water?,116,2
mturk_agent_2,I have a medium amount of water so I would like some more. I wish we had lots of supplies to split up evenly but I'm sure we can work it out🙂,116,2
mturk_agent_1,I agree! We can figure out working out a deal! What if I gave you 2 food and 2 waters and you gave me your wood and one of food/water? If that doesn't work for you we can also figure something else out.,116,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think that sounds reasonable. Of course, I could counter with I take 2 food, 2 waters and 1 firewood. What do you think of that?",116,3
mturk_agent_1,"That is also good. This is hard to work out since it's uneven haha. What about if I give you all my food, you give me all your firewood, and then I can give you 2 waters? I think that'd be more fair for you. ",116,4
mturk_agent_2,Awww thank you! That would be sweet of you. I appreciate it very much and would definitely agree to that deal!,116,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,116,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,116,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi I would like to trade you food for some water 🙂,117,0
mturk_agent_2,How many food would you like to trade for water?,117,0
mturk_agent_1,How about 2 Water for 3 food?,117,1
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like a good deal but I could use some firewood as well. Would you throw one of those in as well?,117,1
mturk_agent_1,That doesn't seem very fair ☹️. That would be 3 food and 1 firewood for 2 water. That is 4 items exchange for 2.,117,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok what if I throw in 3 waters in exchange for 3 food and 1 firewood? So it is a 4 - 3 exchange instead.,117,2
mturk_agent_1,"Actually I changed my mind , lets just do 3 food for 3 water?",117,3
mturk_agent_2,Well that is a little promising but I would really like some firewood as it makes me nice and warm and keeps the camp going 🙂.,117,3
mturk_agent_1,I can do 2 firewood for 3 water if that is better for you?,117,4
mturk_agent_2,Actually that does sound a lot better I would be willing to do that. So 2 firewood for 3 water?,117,4
mturk_agent_1,Yea but what about the food?,117,5
mturk_agent_2,"Oh right, how about you get 3 waters , 2 food and 0 firewood. And I'll get 3 firewood and 1 food?",117,5
mturk_agent_1,That sounds like a good deal to me 🙂,117,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,117,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,117,7
mturk_agent_1,Hi. I'd like to have all the food packages for my children and two of firewood. Will you accept it🙂🙂🙂,118,0
mturk_agent_2,"I apologize but that will not work. I have a diabetic and need to make sure they will have enough food for a hike. So I would like to take two food packages, one water, and two firewood. ",118,0
mturk_agent_1,"That won't work. Because, we are planning for a campfire. And so, we are in need of fire wood. I hope you understand.🙂🙂🙂",118,1
mturk_agent_2,"I understand. We are also planning a campfire, and have a lot of young kids who will need the fire to stay warm. So that's why I feel I need two firewoods. 🙂",118,1
mturk_agent_1,Sorry for apologize. Here we are having old aged people here. I need two packages of food. Otherwise two of firewood.🙂,118,2
mturk_agent_2,I understand. I am willing to give you two packages of food if I can have two firewoods. I would also like two waters due to it being hot out for our hike. 🙂,118,2
mturk_agent_1,Okay. I think it will be good. Then I'll take two packages of food one of  firewood and one of water.🙂🙂,118,3

mturk_agent_2,"I could really use the firewood too, it will be very cold where we are going. Since it will be cold, we will not be drinking much water. How about 2 firewood for you, 3 food for me?, ",119,1
mturk_agent_1,"May I ask how many are going camping with you, i would agree, but the needs of children are different than adults. I will need at least 1 food, to ensure I have enough for the kids. ",119,1
mturk_agent_2,"We will have 50 adults with us. How about 2 firewood, 1 food, 1 water for you?🙂",119,2
mturk_agent_1,"lots of work for the both of us, at least you will have lots of help on you end. I accept the 2 firewood specially if you have elderly with you. will you be okay if give me 2 foods? ",119,2

mturk_agent_1,Hi. I'm most interested in water. What's your highest priority?,12,0
mturk_agent_2,I really need water too. I have a young baby and will do a lot of washing.,12,0
mturk_agent_1,Okay. I'm not especially worried about food. What's your lowest priority?,12,1
mturk_agent_2,"I have enough food too. Can I take 2 water, 1 firewood and 2 food?",12,1
mturk_agent_1,"How about two water, 1 firewood and 1 food, since we both value water the most?",12,2
mturk_agent_2,Is that what you want or what you are offering?,12,2
mturk_agent_1,"That's what I'm offering to you, but I think it's a fair deal, so I'd accept it myself, too.",12,3
mturk_agent_2,Fair enough.,12,3

mturk_agent_2,If I do that I would also like all three firewood,120,1
mturk_agent_1,Why do you need all 3 firewoods?,120,1
mturk_agent_2,"I get cold pretty easily. Extra firewood would help me stay warm. And if I give up all food, I'll need another way to keep my body warm.",120,2
mturk_agent_1,okay how about if i only get 2 food packages and i give you 2 firewood. So we both gets something to help us/ Because i to at least 1 firewood,120,2
mturk_agent_2,That would work for me if I get all 3 water still,120,3
mturk_agent_1,How about you get 2 of the waters an i would take 1 of them? I need some water to stay hydrated ,120,3
mturk_agent_2,If you get two foods then I need more items overall,120,4

mturk_agent_1,Hello!  I'm going to be heading out on a big camping trip and will need to take some extra supplies.  Are you going camping as well?,121,0
mturk_agent_2,I am also going camping! What do you think you're going to need the most of? What are your preferences?,121,0
mturk_agent_1,It's going to be hot during the day where I'm going so I'll need some extra hydration.  So water is my main priority.,121,1
mturk_agent_2,Got it! I am going to need the most of food. There aren't any animals or berries that I feel safe eating where I'm going.,121,1
mturk_agent_1,Well I think we can make a good deal then.  How many packages of food would you want?,121,2
mturk_agent_2,Could we each do 3 of what we need the most? I get three food and you get three water? How do you propose splitting up the firewood?,121,2
mturk_agent_1,We can do the 3 for 3 trade.  That works perfectly!  Its' going to be cold at night where I'm going.  What's it like where you're heading?,121,3
mturk_agent_2,"It's going to be pretty warm where I'm going, but it's also variable. How do you feel about you get 2 wood and I get 1?",121,3
mturk_agent_1,That's mighty kind of you.  We have a deal!  I'll take the 2 wood and you get 1.  Thank you.  You'll also get the 3 packages of food and I'll get the 3 waters.  Deal ?,121,4

mturk_agent_2,"i'm good thank you, How are you doing today?",122,0
mturk_agent_1,"I am good, let's plan our camping trips. I am diabetes, so water is very important to me. what about you?",122,1
mturk_agent_2,I need water too,122,1
mturk_agent_1,what is the next thing you need the most/?,122,2
mturk_agent_2,firewood to keep the body warm ,122,2
mturk_agent_1,"so water, firewood and food for you, and water food and firewood for me. what do you suggest",122,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'm not much of a food fan knowing that without firewood you die of hypothermia if wet, one can survive without food/ with little food for months",122,3
mturk_agent_1,"so let's do this quick, how about 2 water for you, 1 water for me, 0 food for you, 3 food for me",122,4
mturk_agent_2,good excellent choice,122,4
mturk_agent_1,so how do you want to divide the firewood,122,5
mturk_agent_2,take 2 firewood if you wish,122,5
mturk_agent_1,"sure, deal",122,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,122,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,122,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hello. I'm going to do a lot of hiking on my camping trip and need as much water as possible. I'm also planning a bonfire with fellow campers in the area, so I'd like as much firewood as possible. How about I keep the water and firewood and you keep the food?",123,0
mturk_agent_2,"That doesn't work for me. I will also need extra water because I drink a lot. How about we start by saying you get the firewood, and I'll take the food?",123,0
mturk_agent_1,"OK, but how do we split up the water? Because it sounds like we both need some. What if you take all the food and I take all the firewood and then I get two waters and you get one extra?",123,1
mturk_agent_2,I would prefer to have 2 waters since I agreed to give you all the firewood.,123,1
mturk_agent_1,"But I agreed to give you all the food. Now that you want two waters, I think I should have some food because I left a bag of my food at home. You get two waters and I get one of the food. Then you get the majority of both the water and food.",123,2
mturk_agent_2,"So I get 2 waters/2 food/0 firewood, and you get 1 water/1 food/3 firewood? I think that works for me.",123,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that's the plan. By the way, what do you need all that food for? You didn't say. I'm just curious.",123,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'm a bigger guy (6'3"") so I eat a lot, especially after activities like hiking and kayaking. Same reason I want water really.",123,3
mturk_agent_1,"OK, that makes sense. I don't eat as much as you do, so it's only fair that you get most of the food. So I hope this deal will be fair for both of us and you'll walk away happy.",123,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yep, I'm happy, hope you are too! 🙂 I think we can enter the deal now.",123,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I am. I'm entering the deal now.",123,5

mturk_agent_1,Hello there! I look forward to striking up a deal that's good for both of us. 🙂,124,0
mturk_agent_2,"hello, me too. what is most valued to you?",124,0
mturk_agent_1,"I just want to make sure that I get a lot of firewood. It's going to be freezing cold on my trip, and I need to make sure I can stay warm. What's most valued to you?",124,1
mturk_agent_2,unfortunately  i need a lot of wood too. and food. ,124,1
mturk_agent_1,Okay. And what about water? I'd like at least 1 water. I'm going to do a lot of hiking and need to stay hydrated.,124,2
mturk_agent_2,i can give you th water if you give me all the food and some wood,124,2
mturk_agent_1,"So you will give me 3 waters if I give you 3 foods, and 2 wood?",124,3
mturk_agent_2,yes,124,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay. So I will accept 3 waters and 1 wood, and you will accept 3 foods and 2 wood. That's good to me, if that's good to you.",124,4
mturk_agent_2,that sounds like a good deal. if you are good I am too.,124,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,124,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,124,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, How is your camping experience so far 🙂",125,0
mturk_agent_2,It's going well.  🙂  How is yours?,125,0
mturk_agent_1,It was going great until a bear came and took all of our food 😮,125,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh no, that's not good.  I still have some left over, but we're running out of firewood to use to heat it.",125,1
mturk_agent_1,"Seems like we are in the same boat, the bear tore our tent to shreds so we are sleeping outside and it is cold☹️",125,2
mturk_agent_2,Sounds like a rough camping trip.  It has been pretty cold lately.,125,2
mturk_agent_1,Is it possible I could have 3 food since I have none and 2 Firewood to stay warm and you can have 1 Firewood and 3 Water?,125,3
mturk_agent_2,I do still need a little bit of food to get through the rest of the trip.  What if you took 2 food and 2 firewood?,125,3
mturk_agent_1,"If I only had 2 Food and 2 Firewood, I would need 1 Water to wash the food down and put out the Fire when needed",125,4
mturk_agent_2,That makes sense.  I just want to make sure I don't run out of supplies on the trip.,125,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,125,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,125,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello🙂,126,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I'm going camping soon with my family at a lake! We're looking forward to it so much since we haven't been able to get out due to Covid. Are you going camping too?,126,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes! I am also going with my family. My husband and I are essential workers but his hours all got cut. I got laid off from my job for part of the time.,126,1
mturk_agent_1,oh man that sucks ☹️! I know Congress is currently debating all of the unemployment stuff too. Where do you plan to be going camping?,126,1
mturk_agent_2,"We didn't get unemployment or a stimulus check. ☹️ We are planning a trip to Missouri, Lake of the Ozarks. Our younger children have been cooped up so long we are hoping to let them get some sun and swimming in!",126,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds nice, maybe everyone just needs some fun to stay positive about everything. We're going camping along a lake and plan to do a lot of fishing. My husband got these filtration thingies so that we can drink the lake water but I don't really trust them. This will be my kid's first ever camping trip so we're super excited to make it fun for him.",126,2
mturk_agent_2,"We have 7 people in our family,.. the youngest two kids have hardly been anywhere because of working. I think our camping area has those old fashioned hand pumps.☹️",126,3
mturk_agent_1,"Your two youngest kids are working? How old is everyone? If there's a lot of people, it will be easier to split up the duties and get things done. My son's 3 years old so as much as he's eager to help, there's not much he can do lol.",126,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ha Ha...no my too youngest have hardly been anywhere because of us adults working,  I have teens (17, 15), tweens (13) and littles (10, 7). We 3 boys and 3 girls. We have a 21 year old but he's in a band so h can't go. They all pitch in anytime. They eat a lot so they have to cook from scratch at home. Awww 3 is so adorable...that's when they are sure they can do and will work so hard! ",126,4
mturk_agent_1,"Home cooking's the best, yumyums! We're planning on doing a lot of fishing since my son's been in love with fishing toys and is currently in love with eating fish (he hasn't gotten tired of eating it every night for dinner). We're thinking of cooking what we catch every night. Do you have any activities planned for your camping trip?",126,4
mturk_agent_2,"Fishing is so fun! 🙂 We really don't have a plan... so many people, so many opinions. If you'll be fishing and eating your catch, you'll probably need more firewood than food. And with the filters, you will need some extra water, especially for your little guy. So would you agree that you take 2 firewood packages, 1 food package and 1 extra water. ",126,5

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, great to see a fellow camper.  Planing on doing any hikes.  My family and mother-in-law are down getting some new trail maps.  We are looking forward to the long camping weekend.  Our bad luck was the airline loss two of our bags that had our food and water.  So i am hoping to get some more.🙂",127,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! Thats terrible that the airline lost your bags! I'm planning on have a large group of friends with me so we need lots of snacks with us. We are scared of fires so we don't want to make campfires.,127,0
mturk_agent_2,Well maybe we can work something out between us.  Our food and water was in the bags they loss so I really need those.  Do you think you could make do with 1 food and some water?,127,1
mturk_agent_1,I really need 2 foods. I can do with 1 water or if you are in a giving mood then maybe I can have 2 waters? 🙂,127,1
mturk_agent_2,"Looks like we both really need the food.  If you get 2 food I would need 1 food, 2 water and 3 firewood. ",127,2
mturk_agent_1,"Since you will get all the fire would do you think I could have 2 foods and 2 waters. You would get 1 food, 1 water, and 3 firewood. 🙂 You seem like you are a great outdoor person that I would think you would be able to catch some fish to cook with the firewood. 🙂",127,2
mturk_agent_2,No that does work well for me.  If I only have 1 food I need 2 waters and the firewood to make up for the loss of food.,127,3
mturk_agent_1,"What about I have all the food, and you can have everything else? I would think that seems pretty fair.",127,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, I understand where you are coming from but I really need at least one food.  ",127,4
mturk_agent_1,"I'm sorry. I would really appreciate having all the foods, because this camping trip is a get togther with my 5 friends one of whom is her birthday and recently lost her mom. So we need lots of snacks to help her celebrate her birthday and support her during this hard time.",127,4
mturk_agent_2,No I can't do without a food for me.  We can wrap this up if you take 2 food and a water. 🙂🙂,127,5
mturk_agent_1,"How about I get 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood then?",127,5

mturk_agent_2,I get cold very easily and also get thirsty a lot. What are your preferences?,128,1

mturk_agent_2,I want to make smores and a nice dinner,129,1
mturk_agent_1,"I feel like I might need more firewood, I'm staying in the desert and it gets cold at night.",129,1

mturk_agent_2,"How about you get two firewoods and two water, and I take the rest?",129,3

mturk_agent_2,so you want two firewoods and three waters and I get everything else? ,129,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me!,129,4
mturk_agent_2,"I really need at least two firewoods to cook with though, or one water. How can we make this work?",129,5
mturk_agent_1,"I could give you two firewood, if I could still have my three waters and then 1 food.",129,5

mturk_agent_1,"If you really need water, then can I have 2 firewood and 3 food then?",13,4
mturk_agent_2,No I really need food also ...at least I will take 3 food and 2 water and you can take remaining,13,5
mturk_agent_1,"I'll let you take 3 food and 1 water, and I will take the rest.",13,5
mturk_agent_2,That sounds not bad...! Though I need at least 1 more water additional to that,13,6

mturk_agent_1,Well I need some food because what if I get lost as well? ,130,1
mturk_agent_2,"I understand that, but walking away with the most food and the most water would essentially leave me for dead lol. Do you prefer water or food? ",130,2
mturk_agent_1,"I prefer to have the most water as I have a medical condition that requires me to stay extremely hydrated at all times. If I get too dehydrated, it's extremely bad for me. How about I get 3 water and 1 food, and 2 firewood?",130,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'll give you the 3 water, 1 firewood. How about I get 3 food and 2 firewood? I'll need the fire to cook my food.",130,3
mturk_agent_1,"I would need firewood to cook my food as well. I would like the 3 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood, what about that? ",130,3
mturk_agent_2,"Since the value of water exceeds both food & firewood, I think it's fair for me to receive the extra dose of firewood. My offer to you is: you get 3 water, 1 food,  0 firewood.  I would get 0 water, 2 food, 3 firewood.",130,4

mturk_agent_1,I don't like food. my stomach is always full. I only drink water since im thirsty most of the time.,133,3
mturk_agent_2,"yeah i can understand buddy, but the fact is we can share some items. you are not getting food packages and getting packages alone which you preferred. Try some food packages too",133,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay I agree what about this deal. I get 2 water, 1 firewood ,and 1 food package.",133,4

mturk_agent_1,I would really like 2 water and 2 firewood and 1 food.,137,1
mturk_agent_2,I would like 3 water no firewood and 2 food. I have 8 people in my family and I have a medical condition where I can only drink water and have to drink 100 ounces per day.,137,2
mturk_agent_1,Water if very important to me as well. I'm on a medication where I get dehydrated very quickly and I need to make sure that I'm properly hydrated at all times. ,137,2

mturk_agent_1,oh it turns out I need firewood too!🙂,138,1
mturk_agent_2,Ha what a surprise! ;-) What do you need second most?,138,1
mturk_agent_1,I need food to feed all my friends that are coming up. how about you?,138,2
mturk_agent_2,"Haha yup me too. I have a teenage son who eats about 5000 calories a day. Okay, I think the most fair option is one of takes 2 firewood and 1 of the other two items. I don't care who.",138,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sure. How about you take 2 firewood, and 1 food and 1 water?",138,3
mturk_agent_2,That's fine with me. This should be a great weekend to get out.,138,3

mturk_agent_1,Food is the item of greatest value to you?,139,1
mturk_agent_2,It is! What do you think?,139,1
mturk_agent_1,The item of greatest value to me is WATER. Before thinking about an offer I need to know what your priorities are and you need to know mine in order to conclude something fair for both of you.,139,2
mturk_agent_2,My priority is FOOD. How about I get 3 food and you get 3 water?,139,2
mturk_agent_1,What is the least valuable item for you?,139,3
mturk_agent_2,least for me is water,139,3
mturk_agent_1,"For me is the firewood,  Lets do this: I give u 2 food 1 water and 1 firewood. and i get 2 waters 1 food and 2 firewood",139,4

mturk_agent_1,"I'm sorry about that, accidentally hit that send button lol! I was thinking about it as well. I'm pretty excited. How about you?",14,1
mturk_agent_2,I was just thinking about the logistics and how to prioritize the various items.,14,1
mturk_agent_1,Same here. I'll go ahead and list some of what I need and you let me know if you will need the same as well. I need some extra water for our camping trip as well as some additional food. ,14,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds reasonable. I don't particularly need the food because I see that as more of a luxury but I could really use some more water. It's supposed to get really really hot on the weekend. 😮,14,2
mturk_agent_1,I hear that. What do you think of if I take 3 of the food supplies and you can have two waters? ,14,3
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds like a fair compromise. I can get food by hunting animals, old school style. That would give you 4 total items. In that case it's only fair if I take all 3 of the firewood. 4 for me and 4 for you sounds like a good deal to me. 🙂",14,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds fair to me! I don't know the first thing about hunting so that would be a relief on me. We took a bunch of blankets so we'll be good on firewood.  🙂,14,4
mturk_agent_2,Yep and I need all 3 firewood because I'm hunting. Meat absolutely needs to be cooked. The same cannot be said about pepperoni pizza and chips for example.,14,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,14,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,14,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I brought some water with me. How much do you need? ",140,0

mturk_agent_2,"Okay, you can take two and I will take one. ",140,1
mturk_agent_1,Okay that's great,140,1
mturk_agent_2,Can I take all three bundles of firewood so I can boil some of the water? ,140,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, I want some firewood, I planned to enjoy this chill climate using firewood",140,2
mturk_agent_2,Alright. If you take one firewood can I also have two packages of food? ,140,3
mturk_agent_1,"That doesn't work for me, May I ask why do you need two packages of food?",140,3
mturk_agent_2,I did not bring enough food for my last day and there are not very many resources where I am camping ☹️,140,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, If it is the case then you need food. How about you take all 3 food and I will take all firewood",140,4
mturk_agent_2,That works with me. Can you list everything you are taking so we can make sure we are on the same page? ,140,5
mturk_agent_1,"I will take 3 firewood, 1 food, 2 water. You will get 0 firewood, 2 food and 1 water. Is everything correct",140,5

mturk_agent_1,I also have a family I am camping with several small childern and my wife who is pregnant. I need plenty of firewood and water.,141,0
mturk_agent_2,"I get it, in that case and to be a fair deal. I will have 2 of food, 1 of water and firewood each.",141,1
mturk_agent_1,"That seems fair however I would like to have plenty of food also. I think it would be fair to have 2 firewood, 1 food and 2 water ",141,1
mturk_agent_2,I ain't sure if you want 1 or 2 packages of food,141,2
mturk_agent_1,I would like 2 packages of food,141,2
mturk_agent_2,"As you need 2 of firewood, I think we can have a fair deal like 1-2 of food and firewood or 2-1 of food and firewood.",141,3
mturk_agent_1,Ok Im thinking I need plenty of food to for my small children. I have a rather large family so there is more of a need. ,141,3
mturk_agent_2,"Can I have 2 of firewood in that case, as I have food that needs to be cooked and would be a great help.",141,4
mturk_agent_1,Can I have 2 firewood 2 food and 1 water I think this would be enough,141,4

mturk_agent_2,Hi',142,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello I would like to take 3 extra food packages and 3 extra water package and 1 extra firewood packages because we had some unexpected guest join us on our camping trip.🙂,142,0
mturk_agent_2,I need 3 food packages as it is required to feed children who visited unexpectedly. Instead you can take water and firewood,142,1
mturk_agent_1,No that doesn't work for me. I also have children with me. 4 children in total.  how about i take 2 food packages and 2 water packages and you take 1 food 1 water and 3 firewood packages.,142,1
mturk_agent_2,"I too have the same issue. I am also asking for children only , better you could accept 1 food , 2 water and 3 firewood, I hope this deal will work out for you",142,2
mturk_agent_1,I need at least 2 food packages and at least 1 water. I can live with out any extra firewood.,142,2
mturk_agent_2,Please do understand my situation its very very critical to give 2 food packages to you.Instead you can take 3 waters and firewood too.,142,3
mturk_agent_1,No that will not work for me given that I have 4 growing children of different ages who eat like adults. I need at least 2 food packages and 1 water. That gives you 1 food package and 2 waters and 3 firewoods.,142,3
mturk_agent_2,I too have children who eat like adults they too can't able to withstand hunger so you please show some mercy and give me 3 food packages and take all water and firewood,142,4
mturk_agent_1,No I need extra food too. I cannot let my children starve and you cant let your children go thirsty. So if you cant agree to share the food i will walk away from the deal.,142,4
mturk_agent_2,"There is no point in walk away. This deal should be done mutually and beneficial for both. So its better I will take 2 food packages, you can take 1 food package, 2 water and 3 fire wood .Hope this will definitely work for you.",142,5
mturk_agent_1,"No i absolutely need 2 food packages and 1 water. How about we do it like this... You take 1 food package, 2 waters and 2 firewoods. Does that work for you?",142,5
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry to bother you, I don't need anything other than food package. So better you could give me 2 food package and take 3 water and fire wood. Please consider this deal.",142,6
mturk_agent_1,No i absolutely need 2 food packages. So if you cannot agree to take 1 food 2 water and 2 firewood i will walk away.  If you have children with you would would also need water which you are not asking for. ,142,6
mturk_agent_2,"Yes I too have children so only I am considering 2 food package, 1 water is enough for me and I dont need any firewood. So please accept this deal",142,7
mturk_agent_1,😡 I am walking away if i cannot get 2 food packages 1 water and 1 firewood. That leaves you with 1 food 2 waters and 2 firewoods. This is a good deal for you concidering that you havent been asking for water for your children until i mentioned that you need water for you children. Do you agree??,142,7
mturk_agent_2,I already mentioned that 1 water is enough for me.But food is my only priority for my children so you please consider this and help me in this.,142,8

mturk_agent_2,Hi fellow camper! What are your needs for the extra provisions.,144,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi i'm really excited for camping. I am looking for food and water ,144,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, a much needed getaway. Oh my, we need the same provisions! How would you be with receiving two waters, one food package, and two of the firewood?",144,1
mturk_agent_1,I think I would be able to make that work. What are you looking forward to while camping? ,144,1
mturk_agent_2,Mainly cooking because I love to eat. It will be fun this time because I am leaving the kids at home. I also love swimming if we can find a river or big stream. How about you?,144,2
mturk_agent_1,I want to hike the mountains. I think swimming would be really relaxing ,144,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh yes to relaxing! Can you tell I am a bit stressed? Actually, I am pregnant again and just want to practice taking things as they come. Hiking sounds great! Who is camping with you?",144,3
mturk_agent_1,Congratulations! I am camping with my family which will be nice to spend time together ,144,3
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, do enjoy! So you are in agreement about receiving 2 waters and firewoods, and one food?",144,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I really need water to stay hydrated during my camping trip because my food supplies are low. Do you have any to spare?",145,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi.  I can't do that right now.,145,0
mturk_agent_1,Is there anything that you might need? ,145,1
mturk_agent_2,"I would be interested in firewood.  Can I ask you, what are your primary concerns on this trip?",145,1
mturk_agent_1,"My primary concerns are staying hydrated, I have been feeling sick and throwing up from being so high up in the mountains. ",145,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, so sorry to hear that.  I can understand why water would be important to you.  I am worried about being too cold at night. My sleeping bag is not rated well for cold weather (I packed the wring one).",145,2
mturk_agent_1,Oh I understand that for sure. I am not used to the cold weather either which is not helping. Would you be interested in a trade for water in exchange for firewood? ,145,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I am worried about staying hydrated as well.",145,3
mturk_agent_1,Do you have food? I have been trying to hunt but have not really found any animals nearby to hunt.,145,4
mturk_agent_2,I do actually!  I can give you 3 foods. Would that work?,145,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, I can do that.",145,5
mturk_agent_2,"So if I give you 3 woods, can you give me 3 firewoods and 2 waters?",145,5
mturk_agent_1,Yes that sounds like a great deal,145,6
mturk_agent_2,OK great.  Please stand by. ,145,6

mturk_agent_1,"Yes, water is a necessity for being out camping 🙂",146,0
mturk_agent_2,I agree.,146,1
mturk_agent_1,"I myself love food, so food is a big deal to me. ",146,1
mturk_agent_2,Ok.  I like water over firewood.,146,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, firewood isn't really something that's ""essential"" I'd have to say. Yeah, you need it, but still.",146,2
mturk_agent_2,True. 🙂,146,3
mturk_agent_1,Seems like we'll be struggling to see who gets the firewood most of all haha,146,3
mturk_agent_2,"No, I like a little firewood.",146,4
mturk_agent_1,Same here. I need it to cook my vittles 🙂,146,4
mturk_agent_2,I would like to snag one package of firewood and one package of water. 🙂,146,5
mturk_agent_1,"Oops, I guess we are jumping the gun! I don't see a problem with that. You are welcome to one of the firewood and water 🙂",146,5
mturk_agent_2,I think two packages of food would work for me.,146,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,146,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,146,7
mturk_agent_2,Hello my friend! Are you ready to go camping?,147,0
mturk_agent_1,"Getting there, just need some more supplies to be safe.",147,0
mturk_agent_2,Got you! I really need firewood to make smores and I don't think we have enough to last the whole night!,147,1
mturk_agent_1,I was hoping to pick up a lot of wood. It has rained around here and the wood is soggy in the forest.,147,1
mturk_agent_2,Which item do you prefer the most?,147,2
mturk_agent_1,I know how to filter water so you can have all of the water. I would like as much firewood as possible.,147,2
mturk_agent_2,me too. I don't care about water since we are camping near a river.,147,3
mturk_agent_1,I would consider giving you all food and water if I could get all of the wood.,147,3
mturk_agent_2,Oh really? I think I am able to do it without firewood then. The kids will be full and probably won't ask for smores,147,4
mturk_agent_1,Or 1 wood for you and 2 of food and water?,147,4
mturk_agent_2,"I am fine with that as well. So I get  wood, 2 water and 2 food?",147,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,147,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,147,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you?",148,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I am doing well, I am excited about my upcoming camping trip, how are you ?",148,0
mturk_agent_1,"I good thank you.  Yes, I am excited about this trip but I have been worrying about how I can get more firewood.  A raccoon came and stole mine this morning from the campsite.  So would it be alright if I kept all 3 firewoods?",148,1
mturk_agent_2,"No, I have all of my children here with me, they are all afraid of the dark so must burn the fire all night, as I brought no additional source of lighting.",148,1
mturk_agent_1,"ok, fair enough.  How about I take 2 firewood as 1 should do you for a couple nights. I also have small children with me and would like to have the fire burning at all times to keep the bugs away. ",148,2
mturk_agent_2,I really dont see giving up that much of the wood as I cannot risk running out myself. We are camping way too far out to get access to additonal lighting. I tell you what if you will let me have 2 of the fire wood I would be willing to give you two of the food items. I know that racoon probably took your food as well!!,148,2
mturk_agent_1,Okay that is a deal. I would like 3 water as well because my campsite water is very dirty. I would like to have bottled water to take my medicine with and we forgot to pack it.,148,3
mturk_agent_2,"I may consider 2 waters as we are going to be hiking up the tallest mountain in North Carolina and they say temps may reach 100, I must have some have at minimum of 1 package of water.",148,3
mturk_agent_1,"okay, two waters would be great.  So its a deal.",148,4
mturk_agent_2,"So let me recap, I will get two fire woods, 1 food and 1 water, You would get 1 fire wood, 2 food and 2 water. You know you really are getting a fantastic deal, you are so lucky that I am desperate for that wood.",148,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,148,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,148,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I'm really hoping to get a lot of water. I love outdoor activities like hiking and kayaking so I'll need to stay hydrated on the trip.,149,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi! I really need water also. I'm trying out a few new recipes, and they call for a lot of water.",149,0
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, maybe we can split the water and then divy up the rest. What else are you interested in?",149,1
mturk_agent_2,"I was hoping for a decent amount of food, just in case my new recipes don't work out, lol. 🙂",149,1
mturk_agent_1,"Haha, makes sense. I'm also interested in food. What if I take 2 waters and 1 food, and you take 1 water and 2 food?",149,2
mturk_agent_2,I would be okay with that if I could also have all of the firewood. It seems fair since you will be getting the most water. Would that work for you?,149,2
mturk_agent_1,That seems like a lot to compensate for just 1 water. How about I also get 1 firewood?,149,3
mturk_agent_2,I guess that would be okay.,149,3
mturk_agent_1,Great! I'm glad we could reach an agreement. 🙂,149,4
mturk_agent_2,Me too. I hope you have a good trip! 🙂,149,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,149,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,149,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi.  I am looking at possibly taking 3 of the food packages, 2 of the water packages and one of the firewood.  ",15,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi. Why do you need so many food packages?,15,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I have two teenage boys who will be with me.  In normal circumstances they go through a lot of food.  While camping, hiking and kayaking I know we will need plenty to keep their energy level high to do everything.🙂",15,1
mturk_agent_1,Well I will definitely need 2 packages of food and 2 of firewood for survival.,15,1
mturk_agent_2,I am definitely ok with giving you two of the firewood!!  Why do you need 2 packages of food?,15,2
mturk_agent_1,I have a very fast metabolism and a dog to take care of. Thanks for the firewood.,15,2
mturk_agent_2,"Awe!  We have a dog as well, I love dogs!!  How about if you get 1 package of food, 1 water and 2 firewood?  Would that be sufficient for you?",15,3
mturk_agent_1,I know I will need at least 2 packages of food. But you can have 2 of water.,15,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'm so sorry, we're getting very close to the end and will need to make a decision very soon!  We can go without any firewood so How about you get all 2 firewood, 2 water and 1 food.  I will really need at least 2 packages of food for all of us.",15,4
mturk_agent_1,That works for me,15,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,15,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,15,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello!  I'm looking forward to a big camping trip I've been planning for a long time this weekend.  How about you? Do you have any plans?,150,0
mturk_agent_2,Me too!!! I love camping! All that activity gets me wanting to indulge on snacks and then water to quench my thirst!,150,0
mturk_agent_1,Same here.  It looks like we both can use some water and snacks.  Do you have any preferences of how much you will need?  I was hoping to get 2 or 3 waters and 1 or 2 foods?,150,1
mturk_agent_2,Me too. How about you can have 2 water and 1 food if you give me 2 firewood?,150,1
mturk_agent_1,Ok.  So I'll get 2 water and you'll get 1 water?,150,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes. And then I'll get 2 food and you'll get 1 food. And then I'll get 2 firewood and you'll get 1 firewood. How's that?,150,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me.  It looks like it will be a good weekend for both of us.,150,3
mturk_agent_2,I think so too! I hope that hurricane doesn't cause any issues to our plans!,150,3
mturk_agent_1,I think we will be ok.  I'm more worried about the heat.  You can submit the deal if you want.,150,4
mturk_agent_2,Have a great camping trip! Nice meeting you!,150,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,150,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,150,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello!,151,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how are you today?",151,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm good! I'm looking forward to my camping trip this weekend. How about you?,151,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm good as well, I hope the weather works with me 🙂",151,1
mturk_agent_2,Sending good luck your way! Any items in particular you need for your trip?,151,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I'll start with a trial offer and we'll go from there",151,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, offer away!",151,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, food is high on my to do list only because I have a big family and we all know how they eat..... Wood well, I can find that along the way if necessary, and same as water so both of those are fairly low on my list... you?",151,3
mturk_agent_2,"Water is definitely a priority, we're heading out to the desert and there's little water sources out there. While I could use some food, I'd be willing to give you food in exchange for water. We could split the firewood among us?",151,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, it sounds like this will be a great negotiation. Can definitely give you water....",151,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,151,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,151,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I am looking to get more items for the trip.,152,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello there. I am as well. What items were you looking for specifically?🙂,152,0
mturk_agent_2,I am looking for one of each. Food I am especially looking for.,152,1
mturk_agent_1,That sounds pretty reasonable as I am in need of firewood the most. Would it be most reasonable to each take what we need most and split the water down the middle?,152,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, it would.",152,2
mturk_agent_1,I think that sounds fair. The problem is that there are 3 waters and one of us would get two and the other one. How should we sort that?,152,2
mturk_agent_2,You can take the two water. I am not that thirsty most days.,152,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's very generous of you!🙂 If you are sure, then I am in agreement. So we are saying, I get 3 firewood, you get 3 food and you get one water while I get two water?",152,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I think that is okay.",152,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, that sounds fine to me. To me, water is a good substitute for food if I feel hungry. I will submit our agreement then. Thanks for working so amicably. Enjoy your day.",152,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,152,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,152,5
mturk_agent_1,hello,153,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello I hope we can work together to find an offer that satisfies both of us.,153,0
mturk_agent_1,yes we can,153,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, could you tell me which item you need more and which one you need less?",153,1
mturk_agent_1,i will be needing more of water ,153,2
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, what I need most is food because I need nutrients, could you tell me what is the least you need?🙂",153,2
mturk_agent_1,2 water 1 firewood and 1 food,153,3
mturk_agent_2,Can you explain yourself better? What you need the least is food?,153,3
mturk_agent_1,i mean i will be needing 3 water 2 firewood and 1 food,153,4
mturk_agent_2,"I can't give you that since it wouldn't be fair to me, I'll give you a better offer. I get 3 food 1 water 0 firewood and you get 0 Food 2 water and 3 firewood and 2 fire",153,4
mturk_agent_1,no am not accepting that 2 water 2 firewood and 1 food,153,5
mturk_agent_2,"I need you to understand that if we don't have an agreement it doesn't work. What you ask for is not fair. Since you are having more than me, you have calculated correctly and you will realize that what I offer you is the most fair for both🙂",153,5
mturk_agent_1,okay 2 water 1 firewood and 1 food thats all ,153,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,153,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,153,7
mturk_agent_1,Hey! For the camping trip it would be awesome if I could have 3 packages of food. My friend is gluten and dairy free and we need as many options as possible for her. ,154,0
mturk_agent_2,"Aww I'm sorry to hear that, it sounds like it might be better to have her bring her own food. I'll be bringing my teenage son so it would be awesome to get any extra food for him that I can. You know how they be! 🙂",154,0
mturk_agent_1,What about I take 2 of the packages and you take 1? I know teenagers also drink a lot of water haha 🙂,154,1
mturk_agent_2,"He definitely does drink a lot of water, but he's in a growth spurt so 2 would be ideal. I'm happy to give up all firewood in exchange for the extra food!",154,1
mturk_agent_1,"okay that sounds like a better deal then! I will take all the firewood and 1 food, and you can take the 2 food packages",154,2
mturk_agent_2,"Awesome, I appreciate that. How does the water need look on your side?",154,2
mturk_agent_1,I think having two waters would be good for me because my mom forget to pick extras up at the store yesterday😮,154,3
mturk_agent_2,Oh no! Moms can always be so forgetful. I do notice that leaves you with 6 items and me with 3 though. I think it might be better if I take the 2 waters to make it more equal.,154,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hm, I didn't think about that. Good point.",154,4
mturk_agent_2,Does that work for you?,154,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,154,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,154,5
mturk_agent_1,Who is willing to cooperate in a consensual offer so that we can all get fruitful dividends😡,155,0
mturk_agent_2,😮 What is your offer then? ,155,0
mturk_agent_1,"2 of water, plus 2 of food and 0 of firewood",155,1
mturk_agent_2,That doesn't seem totally fair. How about I take 2 water instead? ,155,1
mturk_agent_1,I would give you 2 water in exchange for 3 food and 1 firewood,155,2
mturk_agent_2,Hm. Getting warmer. What do you need the most of? ,155,2
mturk_agent_1,"I need more water than the other options, you can keep 2 food and 2 firewood but 1 water",155,3
mturk_agent_2,"I also feel that water is the most important. How about I take all 3 water, and you can take 2 firewood, and 2 foods?",155,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think the fairest thing would be that you keep 1 water, 2 food, 2 firewood",155,4
mturk_agent_2,"How about I take 2 water, 2 firewood, and 2 food, and then you take the rest",155,4
mturk_agent_1,"Let's stay like this, 2 of water, 1 of food, 1 of firewood and you take the rest",155,5
mturk_agent_2,"I really need the water more than the rest of that stuff. I'll take 2 waters, 1 food, and 1 firewood. ",155,5
mturk_agent_1,"We close the deal if I drink 1 water, 2 meals, and 3 firewood",155,6
mturk_agent_2,"Give me just 1 firewood, and we'll have a deal",155,6
mturk_agent_1,We have a deal,155,7

mturk_agent_1,"I think food, water, and firewood are all going to be fairly important.",159,0
mturk_agent_2,"I agree. I have diabetes, so water and food are super important to me. My diabetes makes me super thirsty and I have to make sure I keep my blood sugar under control with certain foods ☹️",159,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can definitely relate to that, I have family members with type 2 so I know how bad that can get",159,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes definitely! It is a pain for sure, but I love camping so I still want to go! I just have to make sure I have all the supplies I need. ",159,2
mturk_agent_1,I can do without extra water as long as I have food and firewood to purify water I find.  It might be better for you to have a reliable supply though.,159,2
mturk_agent_2,"That totally makes sense! I actually am good on firewood thankfully, I got some from a person selling it from their yard a little bit ago.",159,3
mturk_agent_1,"I would have been able to bring more with me by getting some from my parents, but my father decided he wanted to get rid of what he had left and so has been enjoying his fire pit a lot lately.",159,3
mturk_agent_2,Oh I have always wanted a firepit! I totally understand. If you'd like you can have all 3 of the firewood supply stash to get you started.,159,4
mturk_agent_1,"And I think it's entirely reasonable for you to have all 3 of the water as dehydration can be very bad very quickly, especially with diabetes.",159,4
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds like a fair deal. Food wise, how would you like to split that up?",159,5
mturk_agent_1,"Since I'll be foraging for water and spending more energy on that, how about I take 2 food and you get 1.  Bearing in mind that you're getting all of the stable water supply.",159,5
mturk_agent_2,I can agree on that!,159,6
mturk_agent_1,"You're a very agreeable person, I think we actually made a good deal.",159,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,159,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,159,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, this is my first time camping and I want to make sure I have enough stuff.  I would like three food, three firewood, and two water.  What do you think?",16,0
mturk_agent_2,"I have been camping a few times and pretty much know what I need to be comfortable and healthy.  Warmth and hydration are important for me.  So, I am thinking 2 firewood, 2 water and 0 food.",16,0
mturk_agent_1,"Since I have never been camping before, why do you think you need 2 firewood?",16,1
mturk_agent_2,"Unfortunately, I have arthritis so being sure to keep warm and the dampness away in the evening, heat is important for me.",16,1
mturk_agent_1,Ok.  I am worried about animals and bugs so I would prefer 2 firewood.  But I am happy with the 3 food🙂,16,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, how about we shift a bit as I hear you on the bugs and animals.  I think I can get by with one firewood and use extra covers and meds.  But, will need plenty of water and some food.  How about I take 1 firewood, 2 water and 2 food.",16,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, although I was thinking that I could probably find some firewood, but would prefer more water so I don't get dehydrated and can use it to wash and cook.  How about I take 1 firewood, 2 water, and 1 food",16,3
mturk_agent_2,"Good thought on finding your own firewood.  I appreciate the offer of 2 firewood.  I can cut back on water for washing/cooking.  So how about I take 2 firewood, 1 water and 2 food",16,3
mturk_agent_1,ok that sounds fine🙂,16,4
mturk_agent_2,"Great, thanks for understanding and working with me....and enjoy your first time camping🙂",16,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hello , i am well. i dont need much so i would say an equal amount.",160,0
mturk_agent_1,I have a medical condition that require me to drink a ton of water. I also can only eat certain foods and I have 3 kids. The more food and water the better for us.,160,1
mturk_agent_2,sorry to hear that. i too have kids but my health is ok so i can do with 1 water.,160,1
mturk_agent_1,Thank you. 🙂 Would 1 food and 3 firewood work for you?,160,2
mturk_agent_2,"No problem🙂, i would be fine with 1 water, 1 food,and 3 firewood.",160,2
mturk_agent_1,That works for me. Glad we could hammer out a deal. 🙂 What are you using all the firewood for?,160,3
mturk_agent_2,"so just to be clear that 1 water 1 food and 2 firewoods, and probably have a bon fire.",160,3
mturk_agent_1,"Correct We will take 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood. Very cool.",160,4

mturk_agent_1,My biggest concern is water.  I could really use more.  That and some extra food.,161,1
mturk_agent_2,My biggest concern is food and then water. ,161,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm going to need quite a bit more water, at least 2 packages.  I would like at least 1 food. What do you think?",161,2
mturk_agent_2,How about you take two water and 1 food and 2 firewood?,161,2
mturk_agent_1,That's kind of what I was thinking.  That would work for me.,161,3
mturk_agent_2,"OK, great, I forgot my fishing pole so the extra food will really help!",161,3
mturk_agent_1,The extra firewood will help out keeping the family warm in case the temperature drops.,161,4
mturk_agent_2,"OK, perfect, I think we have reached a good deal🙂",161,4

mturk_agent_1,Well hopefully it will be cooler up in the mountains. What supplies are you in need of?,162,1
mturk_agent_2,I am a big eater. I tend to eat a lot throughout the day. You? 🙂,162,2

mturk_agent_2,"Thirty I see. No problem, we'll work something out. 🙂",162,3
mturk_agent_1,Do you plan on having lots of campfires?,162,3
mturk_agent_2,Probably not since its really hot during these days. How's the weather where you live?🙂,162,4
mturk_agent_1,"Hot here as well. Okay then... How about I'll have 2 waters, 2 firewoods and 1 food, and you 1 water,1 firewood and 2 food?",162,4

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,162,5
mturk_agent_1,"I need some firewood because I did not bring enough, I was thinking I could take 2 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water. What do you think?",163,0
mturk_agent_2,I can do that for you!,163,0
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, so you must prefer water and food over firewood. We might have lucked out as far as our priorities go!🙂",163,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes pretty much that sounds like we can work something out,163,1
mturk_agent_1,Would you be willing to let me have all the firewood and you could take 2 of the food and 2 of the water?,163,2
mturk_agent_2,No I can't do that unfortunately./,163,2

mturk_agent_2,OK ,165,1
mturk_agent_1,Thank you very much. I am anemic so it helps to have all the firewood to keep warm.🙂,165,1
mturk_agent_2,OK NO MENTION AND WHY YOU WANT FOOD,165,2
mturk_agent_1,I tend to eat more food when I am active outside. I drink more water too because I don't want to get dehydrated.,165,2
mturk_agent_2,OH OK ,165,3
mturk_agent_1,Do you have reasons for wanting food?,165,3
mturk_agent_2,FOOD IS GIVE TO THE MORE ENERGY ,165,4

mturk_agent_1,What is it that you really need on this camping trip?,166,0
mturk_agent_2,"I really need some more food. I only have the basics, and I'm afraid it's not going to be enough. What about yourself?",166,0
mturk_agent_1,I really need water because I take medication that requires drinking a lot of water. The firewood I dont need to much off and I need very little food as I am dieting. lol 🙂,166,1
mturk_agent_2,"I totally understand that. And it's pretty important, lol ",166,1
mturk_agent_1,It sure is..So how much food do you need for the trip? Do you need firewood to cook the food? Thank you for understanding my issues. 🙂,166,2
mturk_agent_2,"I definitely need the food the most. I'm definitely not a ""hunter"", so if I were to run out, I'd be in pretty sad shape. I do need the firewood for both cooking, and keeping warm. It gets cold at night where we're going. How about youself?",166,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well since we were already given a few supplies before this deal, I was wondering if you could give me all 3 water, and I could give you all the firewood and 2 of the food packages. I only say all the water because we already have some and my medical condition sucks. lol I wish we could camp together! we seem to be a good match. lol! 🙂",166,3
mturk_agent_2,"I wish that too 🙂 And I 100 percent understand the need for water, but I don't know if I can go with only what I have so far. What if I only took 1 water, and you take 2? I hate to take any because I do understand you need it, but I really can't go without any  ☹️",166,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ahhh you are so nice. I like you! Yes I would agree to giving the one water, but then could you have have 2 firewood instead of all of it. and then you can have 2 food packages. that way I dont have to forage all day in the forest for wood! Camping is supposed to be fun not full of work. ha! 🙂 Did you understand that? I am starting to confuse myself. lol!",166,4
mturk_agent_2,"You're making my day 🙂 So let me get this right, just to be sure. I'll take 2 food, you take 1 food. I take 2 firewood, and you take one. I take one water, and you take the other 2? Do I have that right, lol?",166,4

mturk_agent_2,"That is great to hear!🙂 How about you take 2 food, 2 water and 0 firewood? What do you think?",167,3
mturk_agent_1,uhm.how about i have 3 water 2 foods and zero firewood?,167,4
mturk_agent_2,Are you willing to budge on one water for me? I have 5 people in my group and they really could use one package of water. It is hot out nowadays. ,167,4

mturk_agent_2,"So you will take 2 water and 2 food? If that is the case, deal.",167,5

mturk_agent_2,Food is of the highest preference for me! I am a diabetic and always need to be able to eat if I'm experiencing a low! How about you?,168,1
mturk_agent_1,"Food is also my highest preference, followed by firewood, with water being the lowest. I don't have a medical condition that needs food so I can give you 2 units if I can have 1?",168,1
mturk_agent_2,That would be great if you could! ,168,2
mturk_agent_1,I can do that! What's your next highest priority? I would prefer 2 firewood as I need to be warm at all times and plan to camp in the cooler weather,168,2
mturk_agent_2,I can easily give you two firewood! One should be more than enough for me. Especially since you helped me out with the food!,168,3
mturk_agent_1,I would appreciate that! How do you feel about water?  I would like at least one water.,168,3
mturk_agent_2,I would be more than happy to give you an extra water as well for helping me with the food!,168,4

mturk_agent_2,I really needed firewood also.  I have brought my whole family camping which includes my 2 and 3 year old.  They really need to stay warm,169,2
mturk_agent_1,"I am just going to walk away,  I can't have my family freeze",169,3
mturk_agent_2,"I do not want my family to freeze either but walking away doesn't benefit either of us. How about I take the water and 2 firewoods, you have the rest",169,3
mturk_agent_1,"No deal, I need at least 2 firewood",169,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I can agree to 2 firewood but I will have to take all the food and water to compensate",169,4
mturk_agent_1,"I am walking away, completely unfair",169,5

mturk_agent_1,"You can have ALL the water, and 1 firewood",169,6

mturk_agent_2,"i would prefer water instead of food if possible, but i am sure we can work it out.",17,2
mturk_agent_1,"water is really important for me, how about i get two waters and three firewoods and you get three foods and one water?",17,3
mturk_agent_2,i can work with 1 water 3 food and 1 firewood,17,3

mturk_agent_1,"That makes sense. How about we start out with I get 3 firewood, and you get 3 waters?",170,1
mturk_agent_2,"Great idea, that works for me. 🙂",170,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, let's do that, and then split the food. Since there are only 3, do you want to flip a coin to see who gets 2 of those?",170,2
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds fair, how much food do you feel you need? ",170,2
mturk_agent_1,I would prefer 2 because it's really easy to underestimate how much I could need.,170,3
mturk_agent_2,"That's fine, I'll take 1. I think I have enough with what was originally given. ",170,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds good! So I get 3 firewood, 2 food, 0 water; you get 0 firewood, 1 food, 3 water?",170,4

mturk_agent_2,"I am really bad at cooking so will probably need an extra good just because I'll ruin one of the 3.  Plus Im bringing 2 dogs they can eat the bad food I make 😮  I dont plan on hiking much so how bought I keep all 3 foods, and you keep all 3 waters and we can split the firewood.  2 for me, 1 for you. Great deal!",173,3
mturk_agent_1,"i too i am bad at cooking and i will spend a longer time in the woods so i will need atleast 2 foods, 2 firewood and 1 water",173,4
mturk_agent_2,"But I have more mouths to feed here so I will give you one of the foods, but then need 2 firewood and then take back 1 of the waters.  ",173,4
mturk_agent_1,your dogs could probably hunt for something for you guys. and i would be in the would for a very long time ,173,5
mturk_agent_2,"My dogs are like 12 and 15 pounds.  Hopefully they don't get eaten themselves. What about 2 foods, 2 firewood and 1 water for me.  😮",173,5

mturk_agent_1,I could go for 2 of the waters-I get dehydrated easily so must have those. Would you consider 2 waters and 1 firewood?🙂,174,1
mturk_agent_2,"I would be okay with that, if I can have extra of the food?",174,1
mturk_agent_1,I really don't need a lot of food when camping so I would be happy to agree to that!🙂,174,2
mturk_agent_2,Okay! Sounds fair! Where are you heading out to camp?,174,2
mturk_agent_1,At a campground near where I live that is on a lake (although they call it a creek!).,174,3
mturk_agent_2,That is convenient that it is so close 🙂,174,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes-hope to have a good time. It has been fun dealing with you-hope you have a good camping trip as well.,174,4
mturk_agent_2,"Nice meeting you, friend!",174,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,174,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,174,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello there, I'm in a lot of need for some firewood! I'd not be against taking most of it if that's alright?",175,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I need the all food package. I will frequently feel hungry",175,0
mturk_agent_1,I can give you two of the packages if you're willing to give me all 3 of the firewood. I left mine out in the rain a couple of nights ago so its all ruined.,175,1
mturk_agent_2,If I will give 2 firewood for you and I will take all the food package with 2 water.,175,1
mturk_agent_1,I need all 3 firewood! But I'm willing to discuss food with you. I have a lot of that.,175,2
mturk_agent_2,"Wow. Thank you. Ok. Then I will give you all 3 firewood, however I need all food package with water.",175,2
mturk_agent_1,"How about I get 3 firewood, and you get 2 food AND water? We both win with that, I think.",175,3
mturk_agent_2,So now you need 3 firewood with 1 food. Am I correct?🙂,175,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that sounds fair to me. Although I would be willing to take a water if you're offering it, I am not quite as lucky with water. ☹️",175,4
mturk_agent_2,"How It will be. you already told that, you have lot of food with you. So can you please think how it will be. you can take all 3 firewood with 1 water and I will take all 3 foods packages and 2 water.",175,4
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds fair. I will accept that, all I really need is the firewood anyways! Thank you so much.",175,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,175,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,175,6
mturk_agent_2,"Good evening, how are you doing today?",176,0
mturk_agent_1,Welcome to the camping trip Dude!,176,0
mturk_agent_2,"Welcome! I'm really concerned about our water supply, we are desperately low. We don't have much food, a few protein bars. how are things looking your way?",176,1
mturk_agent_1,I haven't got too the site yet but I am almost there.  I can't wait to finally relax!  I have been going nonstop for days.  Good idea to check supplies!,176,1
mturk_agent_2,We're nearly there and just realized that we must have missed picking up some of our stuff before leaving.,176,2
mturk_agent_1,"Were we supposed to bring things?  Oh, no!  I'm gonna die...",176,2
mturk_agent_2,"Of course, it's always wise to bring things. We absolutely need water and some food. Water is critical though.",176,3
mturk_agent_1,You got that right!  I just came from a three-day rugby tournament and I am totally dehydrated.  I hope they have enough at the site.  I also get the chills bigtime when I am dehydrated. That's how I know I am very dehydrated...,176,3
mturk_agent_2,I'm good to give up firewood for more water and food.,176,4
mturk_agent_1,Thanks!  You can have all the extra food. My pockets are jammed full of munchies.  But water is something it seems we both really need.,176,4
mturk_agent_2,"I'll do 2 water and 0 firewood, 3 food.",176,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, good news!  My site is next to a vending machine.  Mostly Ding Dongs and Ho Hos, but there is a bottle of water in there.  I can go with your recommendations.  I'll take three firewood, 1 water, and no food.  But I may be by your site later to borrow toilet paper. OK?",176,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,176,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,176,6
mturk_agent_2,"hi, how are you? my main need is water. how bout you?",177,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey hi, nice getting to interact with you. I'm doing good, thank you. Wish it's the same with you. I get dehydrated quickly and need additional packages of water.",177,0
mturk_agent_2,we both have the same high value priority. what is number 2 for you? thanks,177,1
mturk_agent_1,🙂 Food,177,1
mturk_agent_2,"me 2 lol, what if you got 2 of the water and me 1 but then i could do 2 of the food and firewood and things would kind of even out with that arrangement.",177,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that would be fair. How much of Firewood would you need?",177,2
mturk_agent_2,2 firewood and 2 food and 1 water.,177,3
mturk_agent_1,I get it as you need more firewood for the additional package of food.,177,3
mturk_agent_2,"exactly, and forgot some of my extra wood at the house again.",177,4
mturk_agent_1,Have a nice camping trip 🙂,177,4
mturk_agent_2,you as well,177,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,177,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,177,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I am very cold and need food and wood to remain warm. How about I get 3 firewood, 3 food and 1 water?",178,0
mturk_agent_2,That doesn't really work for me because then I would get only 2 waters and nothing else ☹️. What do you think is your highest priority?,178,0
mturk_agent_1,Wood is my highest priority. I need it to stay warm. I'm very cold-natured. What is your highest priority? 🙂,178,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh that's good. Wood is not my highest priority since I get hot easily lol. My highest priority is probably food because I have a very high metabolism and get very hungry,178,1
mturk_agent_1,"I understand that. I also need food though, because I need the sustenance to help warm me up. So maybe 3 firewood 1 food and 2 waters for me?",178,2
mturk_agent_2,"I still don't think that is too fair though, since you would be getting 6/9 of the extra items and I would only be getting 3... I'm not an avid camper so I need extra amenities to make sure I survive haha. I am flexible on the water though - maybe we can compromise there. I am fine with you having all of the wood. Maybe we could give you 3 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water?",178,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds very fair to me. Thank you for being understanding. 🙂,178,3
mturk_agent_2,Definitely! I am glad we could come to an agreement. Do you like to camp a lot? Or hike?,178,3
mturk_agent_1,I love to camp! Especially when there is enough firewood! It is a great (and inexpensive) activity for me I get a lot of enjoyment out of. Hopefully you will become an avid camper after this trip!,178,4
mturk_agent_2,"Haha maybe! I am afraid of some bugs though, especially ticks 😮",178,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, you have to check EVERYWHERE for ticks! And since we've come to an agreement, I will submit our deal!",178,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,178,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,178,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, how are you?",179,0
mturk_agent_1,"Great, how are you?",179,0
mturk_agent_2,"Pretty good, planning my camping trip, checking on supplies.",179,1
mturk_agent_1,"Here too, looks like the weather has changed for us. We won't have enough water to last as we forgot it. Food, we have some snacks, but not enough to get by for our trip. I'm not overly concerned about firewood since it's so hot. But I'm really concerned about water.",179,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, I'm going to the desert so I'm hoping to have enough water. I'm good on food and I hunt for a lot of it anyways.",179,2
mturk_agent_1,I've never been a good hunter. I wish I had those abilities.,179,2
mturk_agent_2,I would part with all the food if I could get all the firewood.,179,3
mturk_agent_1,That seems fair. How about water. How would that be split? I'm very concerned.,179,3
mturk_agent_2,Me too. There is little natural sources where I'm going. ,179,4
mturk_agent_1,I'm not familiar with my surroundings. None of us going have ever been to this spot.,179,4
mturk_agent_2,I mean I would give two waters if I could get one more food. So 2 water for you and 2 food.,179,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,179,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,179,6
mturk_agent_2,I'd like to keep all the firewood if I'm giving the majority of the water.,179,6
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, that seems fair.",179,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,179,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,179,8
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, what are your preferences for food, water, and firewood?",18,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, nice getting to interact with you. I would like to have additional packages of firewood and water",18,0
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I would like to have additional packages of food and water.",18,1
mturk_agent_2,I would take 2 packages of firewood and 1 each of water and food. Let me know your thoughts.,18,1
mturk_agent_1,I actually need 2 packages of firewood for making more fires when camping.,18,2
mturk_agent_2,I can't take cold and would badly need to have more firewood.,18,2
mturk_agent_1,I need more firewood to keep my food going.,18,3
mturk_agent_2,"I get it, in that case I'' take additional packages of food.",18,3
mturk_agent_1,"I don't think so, because I need additional packages of food in case there is an emergency.",18,4
mturk_agent_2,I was under the impression you don't have the need for additional firewood as you mentioned you need additional of food and water. Let me know how many packages of item you need.,18,4
mturk_agent_1,"You're right, I meant to say that I need additional food and water.",18,5
mturk_agent_2,"So, let me know how much exactly do you want of each item",18,5
mturk_agent_1,I would like 2 packages of food and 2 packages of water.,18,6
mturk_agent_2,"In that case, I can take 2 packages of firewood. So , it would be a fair deal. I can share with you in case you have the need.",18,6
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, that is a fair deal then. It is settled.",18,7
mturk_agent_2,Thank you. Have a nice day ahead!,18,7
mturk_agent_1,Thank you. Have a nice day ahead too!,18,8
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,18,8
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,18,9
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I would like to have three packages of food. We've decided to stay an extra night but need more food to do so.",180,0
mturk_agent_1,I would be open to that if you could give me three packages of water 🙂,180,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hmmm...I'm pretty muddy due to clumsiness, so I may need one extra. I could give you two waters and all of the firewood. What do you think? 🙂",180,1
mturk_agent_1,"So are you suggesting that I would get 2 waters, 3 firewood, and no food?",180,1
mturk_agent_2,"Right! Well, beyond the food you already have. ",180,2
mturk_agent_1,"I have an extra person camping with us that I didn't expect when I bought food, so I could use one if you're willing 🙂",180,2
mturk_agent_2,"I understand that! I wasn't expecting to stay an extra night, but the weather is too perfect to leave. I can manage with two packages of food for sure. 🙂",180,3
mturk_agent_1,Great!  Thank you for being so understanding!,180,3
mturk_agent_2,"No problem! So are we in agreement that I get 2 food, 1 water and you get the reverse? I could also probably use one firewood, but it's not as important to me.",180,4
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you one firewood, so I'll be getting 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood?",180,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,180,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,180,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I'm packing for my camping adventure.,181,0
mturk_agent_2,I am too.  I am so looking forward to this.  ,181,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes! I am so on the same page as you. I want to be sure I'm set and prepared. 🙂,181,1
mturk_agent_2,Would you consider letting me have 2 of the 3 extra firewood?  I have health issues and I get really cold sometimes.☹️,181,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I think that would be very fair, since I don't have health issues myself. Would you allow me to have 2 of the 3 food items? I need energy for hiking. 🙂",181,2
mturk_agent_2,"That would be perfect.  I am a gourmet cook and if you would like me to help you prepare the evening meal, I would be very happy too.🙂",181,2
mturk_agent_1,That's so nice of you! I would be delighted to have some great meals during this camping vacay. 🙂🙂,181,3
mturk_agent_2,I have managed to bring pouches of some of my favorite seasonings.  I'm hoping to find some great wild mushrooms in the forest too.  ,181,3
mturk_agent_1,I'm a big fan of well seasoned food and mushrooms! Mmm.. 🙂 Do you think it would also be alright for me to have 2 of the 3 waters since I will be hiking a lot?,181,4
mturk_agent_2,"That would be fine.  I was hoping to have 2 but since I am only walking and you are doing more heavy duty hiking, you take them.  Agreed?",181,4
mturk_agent_1,I really appreciate that. Do you think you will be okay with just 1 water since you have health issues?,181,5
mturk_agent_2,"That would be very nice, but I worry about you not having enough on the trail.  Dehydration would not be good.  I am pretty sure I can ration my supply to make it last.  🙂",181,5
mturk_agent_1,You're a good friend! I'm excited to embark on this adventure! 🙂🙂🙂,181,6
mturk_agent_2,"Me too!  So let me clarify:  I will take 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food.  You will take 1 Firewood, 2 water and 2 food.  Is that right.  🙂🙂🙂",181,6
mturk_agent_1,Agreed! 🙂,181,7

mturk_agent_2,"Oh yeah, that's for sure. What camping item do you prioritize?",182,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm going to need some extra wood because I'm somewhat injured and can't really gather more.,182,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, I see. Well, I personally need lots of water to stay hydrated since I drank a lot already.",182,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that's important. I don't need much.",182,2
mturk_agent_2,"The thing I need less, but still sort of want some of, is food.",182,2
mturk_agent_1,"I'm like that as well, a small appetite.",182,3
mturk_agent_2,"I need firewood the least of all though, because I have a lot of coats for warmth.",182,3
mturk_agent_1,Are you bringing several coats while camping?,182,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, I might even have too many.I still need water the most,so I'm thinking I should take the water and you should take the firewood.",182,4
mturk_agent_1,I can deal with that. I'd rather a little thirst than being cold.,182,5
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, So I'll take all three water, you'll take all three firewood package and I'll take one food package and you get two. What do you think? 🙂",182,5

mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I am but I do have my worries. How about you? ",183,1
mturk_agent_1,Me too! im bringing my 5 month old baby with me and im worried im not gonna be able to find purified water for his formula!,183,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ah, Baby's first camping trip. 🙂 But that is a bit of a big worry. ",183,2
mturk_agent_1,Yea so I was hoping i could get 3 of the waters if possible and 1 firewood and you can have the rest!,183,2
mturk_agent_2,"I really wish I could take you up on that offer but I could really use some of that water as well. Perhaps, I can get one water while I'll give you some extra food.",183,3
mturk_agent_1,okay so how about i take 2 waters 1 firewood and 2 food?,183,3
mturk_agent_2,Are you sure that's enough firewood for you and the baby? I know that babies can easily get very sick from dropping temperatures.,183,4
mturk_agent_1, would you mind then if i take 2 waters 2 firewood and 1 food? does that work for you?,183,4
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like a deal to me. Please be careful with your baby on your trip.🙂,183,5

mturk_agent_2,I am sooooo excited too! I can't wait to sit by the fire! 🙂,184,0
mturk_agent_1,Me too!!!! That is what I am most excited about. I was actually hoping you might have some firewood to spare?,184,1
mturk_agent_2,"Gosh, that's a bg favor because I need the firewood. I will give you all of the firewood if you will give me all of the food. How's that?",184,1
mturk_agent_1,Fair enough! Thank you! I would really appreciate any extra water that you have too?,184,2
mturk_agent_2,I need some water...I'll give you two of mine so that I can hang on to one.Is that okay with you?,184,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that works! Thank you! Where are you heading out to camp?",184,3
mturk_agent_2,Out in the North Carolina mountains! We camp there every summer. So many great memories!,184,3
mturk_agent_1,"How fun! I am somewhat new to camping. I have only been twice. But, I agree - it's a great way to make memories! 🙂",184,4

mturk_agent_1,"same, can I get 3 food, 2 firewood and 0 water, I need 3 food because i need food to survive",185,1
mturk_agent_2,That is actually close to perfect for me because I severely need water. Would you consider giving me 2 firewood instead of 1? ,185,1
mturk_agent_1,sure,185,2
mturk_agent_2,That is awesome. I really appreciate it. ,185,2
mturk_agent_1,"i will get 3 food, 1 firewood and 0 water then",185,3

mturk_agent_1,Hello,186,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I am going on an expedition and am in need of provisions. The risk is much, the need is great, but the rewards are even greater! I am asking that you might allow me to have 3 firewood, 2 food, and 2 water.",186,0
mturk_agent_1,Why do you need so much firewood?🙂,186,1
mturk_agent_2,"My camping expedition is in the far reaches of the north, away from civilization. I've already lost three fingers to frostbite, and I can ill afford to lose another. In short, I need the firewood - for fire. And warmth.",186,1
mturk_agent_1,Sorry to hear about your problems. Are you going to Canada this time?,186,2
mturk_agent_2,Farther. I'm going so far north that we'll be passing over the north pole and keep going into Siberia.,186,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sound cool, I mean cold. 🙂",186,3
mturk_agent_2,It will be. And I'm grateful that you recognize the need! Will you do me a solid by permitting me to have these provisions?,186,3
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you 3 firewood, but only 1 food and no water.",186,4
mturk_agent_2,Good gravy! I will need to cancel the expedition if that's all you have to spare. Can you surely do no better?,186,4
mturk_agent_1,"I do like to have lots of water because I get thirsty on some of my longer hikes. How about I give you 3 firewood, 1 food and 1 water?",186,5
mturk_agent_2,"I see. I can get by without the water, but I need more food. With 2 food, I will probably need to eat my dog, but I will survive. Will you give me 3 firewood, 2 food, and no water?",186,5
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me. Let's make this deal.,186,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,186,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,186,7
mturk_agent_1,Hi how are you? I have a few medical issue and do need to stay warm so fire wood is important to me. What is important to you? ,187,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I also need firewood. It is my highest priority. Then, I need water next as a prority. 🙂",187,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes that matches with my needs as well I need to stay warm due to health conditions and need plenty of water due to medicines. ,187,1
mturk_agent_2,We could split the firewood and water. I can take two water and one firewood. 🙂,187,1
mturk_agent_1,Ok what about the food? how about you take two and ill take one?,187,2
mturk_agent_2,Okay! That sounds good! 🙂,187,2
mturk_agent_1,"Great so we are on the same page. Ill take two fire wood, one water, and one food.",187,3
mturk_agent_2,Okay! Then it's a deal! 🙂,187,3

mturk_agent_1,"I would love to have extra food for my trip, bringing the family! how about you?",188,0
mturk_agent_2,"I agree, it will be tricky to find extra food while camping. I'm sure we can figure out something that works for both of us... the water is also very important to me because it's supposed to be hot. There is plenty of wood where I'm going, so you can have the firewood. Would you be willing to take 3 firewood, 1 food and 1 food?",188,1
mturk_agent_1,"I would like at least 2 food, how does me getting 2 food, 1 water,2 firewood sound?",188,1
mturk_agent_2,I think I can only give away 2 food if you are willing to give up all of the water. How about you take 2 food and 2 firewood? ,188,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think that sounds reasonable, i dont get too thirsty!",188,2

mturk_agent_2,"Nice, so are we!",189,0
mturk_agent_1,That is awesome! The one bad thing about my campsite is there's no stream or lake nearby. I'm going to need a lot of it so I can shower/wash up,189,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well I was hoping to grab some extra water as well, Its suppose to be record highs. ",189,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm sure we can figure something out. I'm going to need a good amount of firewood too to cook my food. The good news is I won't need any food 🙂,189,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well I'm not interested in any firewood, I already have plenty, I do need extra food however",189,2
mturk_agent_1,"Would you accept 1 water, 1 firewood and 3 food?",189,3
mturk_agent_2,I do believe that will work for me.,189,3

mturk_agent_2,Great and yourself? Ready for this camping trip and take a break from modern civilization?,19,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm doing well. Yes. This camping trip is badly needed!,19,1
mturk_agent_2,Indeed we have planned to do a lot of hiking and seeing the nature that is giving to us by god it will be a great wonderful time to serve with others and deepen our faith in the lord savior ,19,2
mturk_agent_1,Awesome. I couldn't agree more. I feel that camping and hiking are both such spiritual experiences. It's such a perfect time to connect with our lord and savior. I love serving others as well.🙂,19,2
mturk_agent_2,":) Yes and you know what we are experiencing some difficulty as some people who said initially they were not going to be able to come and at the last minute are saying that they are coming so we are short on the most important items which are food and was wondering if we could speak about sharing items but due to the people who joined late if I can get food and water you can have more wood as none of us know how to really go into the wild and we do not want to turn away our last minute guests, it would be of tremendous help   ",19,3
mturk_agent_1,I'm more than willing to help you to the best of my ability. I understand and appreciate the difficult situation you find yourself in. How many packages of food and water do you think you will need for your additional guests? How much wood do you need since you are saying you don't need much?,19,3
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks for your understanding well I think if possible then to meet the situation then how bout 3 food and 2 water then you get all the wood ? That way you can have awesome campfires lasting through the night, we will be going to sleep extra early to wake up very early so we do not need all that wood, as much as we need food to replenish our energy and be ready for another day of long walks to see as much as we can from nature 🙂",19,4
mturk_agent_1,I agree with you that campfires are awesome and I do find them to be be quite useful. I'm not as early of a riser as you are unfortunately! 🙂 I'm willing to accept your offer on food as long as you could please consider my needs for water. I am a very active hiker. While I don't need much food for my hikes I do require a lot of water. I once went on a hiking trip when I was new to the activity and ran out of water. I got lost and almost dehydrated! Ever since then it's been very important to me to have as much water as possible. What would it take in order for me to get as much water as possible keeping in mind that I'm willing to give you 3 food. ,19,4
mturk_agent_2,Thank you for the food and I understand we do have to think about water being by far the most important thing in life since it bascially is right 🙂 and well how about then we go do two waters for you and one wood then so then we can have that wood for just in case and we can all be happy ?? thanks for your understanding,19,5
mturk_agent_1,"Yes. Water is the most important thing in life. Thank you for offering me two waters and one wood. However, this would mean that you would be receiving 3 food, 1 water, and 2 wood. That seems too unbalanced to me. It's important for me to also let you know that wood is very crucial for me. When I was a newbie I didn't bring any wood because I figured I'm fine since I'm not scared of the dark. That night a bear snuck on me when I was sleeping. Thankfully I was able to scare it away with noise. However, ever since then I've brought a lot of wood with me so no bears can sneak up on me. I would like to counter your offer with 3 waters, 2 wood, and 0 food. This means you get 1 wood and 3 food. Does this offer work for you?",19,5
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,19,6
mturk_agent_1,I want all the water and all the food. What do you want?,190,0
mturk_agent_2,I would like all food and 1 water,190,0
mturk_agent_1,You can have all the water if I can have all the food.,190,1
mturk_agent_2,"how about 2 food for me, 2 water for you?",190,1
mturk_agent_1,"How about 2 food for me, 2 water for me, and you can have everything else",190,2
mturk_agent_2,okay 2 food & 2 water for you 🙂,190,2
mturk_agent_1,"great, that sounds good",190,3
mturk_agent_2,have fun camping,190,3

mturk_agent_2,"hmmm, well what are you looking to get",191,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I think that for us staying warm is more important than having extra food. What if I took extra fire wood and you took extra food?",191,1
mturk_agent_2,"That could work, were not really looking to have a big fire",191,2
mturk_agent_1,"Where do you stand on water? We're low , and may need extra in case the fires go out of control",191,2
mturk_agent_2,I do need some myself as well,191,3
mturk_agent_1,I suppose it is important - we'll definitely have split that up somehow. ,191,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well how about this. I take all the Food, and 1 Water. You get all the Firewood and 2 Water.",191,4
mturk_agent_1,we're definitely thinking alike - That extra water would go a long way to keep us safe and comfortable,191,4

mturk_agent_1,I need 2 firewood and 2 water because that's my most pressing need,193,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, I want 1 firewood, 1 water and 3 food. If you agree for this deal.",193,3
mturk_agent_1,"So you get 1 firewood, 1 water, and 3 food? and I get 2 firewood and 2 water?",193,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, I'm misspelled of water package 1 water instead of 2 water. Actually i want 1 firewood, 2 water and 3 food.",193,4
mturk_agent_1,I need 2 firewood and 2 water. I cant give you the extra water,193,4

mturk_agent_1,Hi there - I need extra firewood,194,0
mturk_agent_2,So do I. I have a medical condition that causes my veins to close when I get cold. ☹️,194,0
mturk_agent_1,"I really need it for my children who get cold at night and we read bedtime stories, so need to be able to see.  Lastly, I really need it to warm up a bottle for my baby.",194,1
mturk_agent_2,"You have kids!🙂 Do you need extra food? I'm on a diet, so I don't eat so much.",194,1
mturk_agent_1,I have food because my baby is mostly on bottled milk. Can I 2 firewood and 2 waters to mix up the formula?,194,2
mturk_agent_2,I would be willing to give you two waters if I could have two firewood. I don't want my veins to close and freeze to death.,194,2
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, but I really need the firewood for my kids. There are 4 of us.",194,3
mturk_agent_2,"I understand, but if my veins shut down I could die.",194,3
mturk_agent_1,Alright alright... I'll give you 2 firewood for all the food and water 🙂,194,4

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,194,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I didn't bring enough food with me. Can I take all three packages of food? You can take as much water as you need.",195,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi! I'm sorry to hear about the food. You can have all of the food, but in exchange, can I have all of the firewood? It's going to be freezing out, and without all of that wood to burn, my family might get hypothermia.",195,0
mturk_agent_2,I would like at least one of the firewood bundles. You can have all of the water and I can boil some from the river. Does that work with you? ,195,1
mturk_agent_1,"That would only work if I can take 1 of the food. I'm doing a ton of hiking, and I'm going to need to fight off starvation. You can have the rest of the food, though. Does that work?",195,1
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds okay with me, but I would like one of the waters in exchange. ",195,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I can work with that. So you'll take 2 foods, 1 firewood, 1 water, and I'll take 1 food, 2 firewood, and 2 waters?",195,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good to me 🙂,195,3
mturk_agent_1,"Wonderful! That was simpler than expected. Would you like to put in the trade, or shall I?",195,3

mturk_agent_2,"Alright, if I can have two of the food packages you can take two of the waters. ",196,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh i'm sorry i meant i will give you 2 foods and i get 1,196,1
mturk_agent_2,Can I have two of the firewood so I can boil water? ,196,2
mturk_agent_1," I can give you 3 of the firewood, if i can have all 3 of the water",196,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like a deal. Can you repeat everything you are taking so we can make sure we are on the same page? ,196,3
mturk_agent_1,"I get 1 food an you get 2, i get 3 waters and you get 0, I get 0 firewood and you get 3. Is this correct?",196,3

mturk_agent_2,same. I love to fish and be outdoors!,197,2
mturk_agent_1,"Me too! I'm a little worried about my water situation, though. I'm newly pregnant, so a lot of foods are making me nauseous. I need to make sure that I have enough water to compensate.",197,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, congrats! Going camping when pregnant seems crazy to me, but to each there own",197,3
mturk_agent_1,I want to make sure to have a lot of fun before I get so big and miserable. Would it be okay with you for me to have all of the water?,197,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, what do I get in return. I need water too ☹️",197,4
mturk_agent_1,What do you want the most?,197,4
mturk_agent_2,"I need water the most, but since you're pregnant and need it... I'm willing to let you have it all if I get 3 and 3 of food and firewood",197,5

mturk_agent_1,Hello friend! I'm suuper excited 🙂,198,0
mturk_agent_2,Me too🙂. What do you think of the items? which one do you prefer the most?,198,1
mturk_agent_1,"well I honestly prefer Firewood and food, what about you?",198,1
mturk_agent_2,I would love to get more water. I don't really care about food since I am still full. I ate too much at home. ,198,2
mturk_agent_1,hahaha that is fine... so what do you think about you gettin 3 packages of water and I get the firewood and food?,198,2
mturk_agent_2,Is water your least prefer item?,198,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes it is and since is your most prefer item I think we both win.. do you agree?,198,3
mturk_agent_2,Which one is your highest priority? Firewood or food?,198,4
mturk_agent_1,"Honestly Firewood, i really need more of this.",198,4
mturk_agent_2,"Well I need some firewood but since we are buddies, I will give you all if you give me my water. But at least we should divide the food, right?",198,5
mturk_agent_1,I think that is fair.. do you need 1 package of food?,198,5
mturk_agent_2,Ok. That is good for me. I think I can catch some fish in the river. ,198,6
mturk_agent_1,"excellent, do we have a deal?",198,6
mturk_agent_2,"it is a deal, my friend.",198,7
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,198,7

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, fellow camper.🙂",199,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, there. Quite a trip we have lined up.",199,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, it is.  What items would you like to have?",199,1
mturk_agent_2,I hear it might rain. We would need to keep fire longer to dry off our clothes. Firewood would come in very handy.,199,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I would like 2 firewood, 2 food, and 2 water.",199,2
mturk_agent_2,Are some of them more important to you than others? I'm really concerned about having firewood. Food is not as important.,199,2
mturk_agent_1,"I'm not really that concerned about water, especially as it might be wet weather.",199,3
mturk_agent_2,"What's your take on food? We heed it to maintain energy while hiking, but I think we'll not do as much of that. We'll mostly stay by the camp site.",199,3
mturk_agent_1,"I tend to get low blood sugar, and need to eat if I start feeling faint.  How about I take 2 firewood, 2 food, and 1 water?",199,4
mturk_agent_2,"How about you take 1 firewood, 3 food, 1 water instead?  You will still get 5 out of 9 items we have.",199,4
mturk_agent_1,That would work for me.,199,5
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good.,199,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,199,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,199,6
mturk_agent_2,Hey there!,2,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi! How are you?! You excited for your camping trip??! I sure am ready to go on mine!,2,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am very excited, I'm actually going camping in a week. I drink a lot of water so it's important that I bring a lot. What about you?",2,1
mturk_agent_1,"I really am! I have been watching the weather and updates about the area I will be traveling to.  They are experiencing a severe drought, so I will be in need of some extra water as well! I planned on staying an extra couple days as well.  There is a stream nearby I believe, but I'm not sure how much it has dried up.",2,1
mturk_agent_2,"That's good to hear, you always have to be careful with wild water though, it has all kind of germs. Sounds like you'll have plenty of dry firewood though. ",2,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I would be willing to let you have all the firewood for 2 of the cases of water.  How much food were you needing?",2,2
mturk_agent_2,I like your water and firewood arrangement. Can I have 2 of the food since you're getting 2 of the water? ,2,3
mturk_agent_1,Let me think on that. I know there won't be much for berries or small animals to hunt for.  Is where you are going have much available for you to hunt and scavenge for?,2,3
mturk_agent_2,It might but with the summer season hunting isn't exactly legal at the moment. I tend to camp in remote areas so going to the store for more food isn't really an option. I've already let you have extra water so I don't think it's too far of a stretch to let me have some extra food.,2,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I can let you have 2 of the food then.  I do appreciate your generosity on the extra water.  ",2,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,2,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,2,5
mturk_agent_2,hi there🙂,20,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I hope we can reach a good deal. I am in desperate need of firewoood and water",20,0
mturk_agent_2,I also need water.  You would not believe how much my family and I sweat!,20,1
mturk_agent_1,I understand. I am unfortunately sick and need the warmth of the fire and water to take my medication or I will die very soon,20,1
mturk_agent_2,"You can have all of the firewood, we just need 1 water ",20,2
mturk_agent_1,That is fair. Could I also have 1 food so I do not starve,20,2
mturk_agent_2,what about your basic food rations?,20,3
mturk_agent_1,I am severely malnourished and could use just one more food please,20,3
mturk_agent_2,"we got kids on this trip, they need food too.  also, your basic supplies should keep you fed well enough to not starve/be malnourished",20,4
mturk_agent_1,I have kids as well who need food. I am just asking for one more food,20,4
mturk_agent_2,"we've given you all of the firewood, 2 of the waters",20,5
mturk_agent_1,If you could add just one food I think we have a deal,20,5

mturk_agent_2,"Cool, let's see if we can workout a deal.",200,1
mturk_agent_1,I do really need water the most because my body is big and get dehydrate faster than normal.,200,2
mturk_agent_2,I can spare one if you i could get firewood. i really need some.,200,2
mturk_agent_1,Can I get 3 of water and food and 1 of firewood?,200,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can't give you 3, I at least 2 myself due to my heavy equpiment, but could use etra firewood because I brought my light sleeping bag. Can I get 1 water and 2 firewoods?",200,3
mturk_agent_1,"You can have 1 water and 2 firewoods. I can have 3 water, 3 food, and 1 firewood.",200,4
mturk_agent_2,"How about I get 2 water,2 firewood, and 1 food?",200,4
mturk_agent_1,1 water will not be enough for my body.,200,5
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I can settle with 1 water,2 firewood, and 2 food?",200,5
mturk_agent_1,"I wish I could get 3 water and 3 food and 1 firewood is fine for me. However, I do understand you would need it as well so please let me have at least 2 water and 2 food and 1 firewood. Many Thanks.",200,6
mturk_agent_2,"If I can get the extra food we have a deal, I would love to have a extra meal.",200,6
mturk_agent_1,What is your preference? We could work it out. My need is water and food.,200,7
mturk_agent_2,I need the firewood.,200,7
mturk_agent_1,"Let's work on this deal you will have 2 firewood, 1 food and 1 water.",200,8
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds good, I can settle with that.",200,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,200,9
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,200,9
mturk_agent_1,hello,201,0
mturk_agent_2,"Good day, sir. I'm going camping and I need extra supplies. Would you allow me to have 3 firewood, 2 water, and 2 food?",201,0
mturk_agent_1,okay🙂,201,1
mturk_agent_2,Thank you so much. Are you going camping too then?,201,1
mturk_agent_1,Im going camping also but I did want to back track and ask for 1 of those firewoods back please.  its for health reasons,201,2
mturk_agent_2,"I see. So that would give me 2 firewood, 2 water, and 2 food. I believe I can manage it. Is firewood what you need most?",201,2
mturk_agent_1,"actually it would be 1 firewood, 2 waters and 2 foods",201,3
mturk_agent_2,Hmmm... this agreement is changing rapidly.,201,3
mturk_agent_1,i actuallly meant to say that in the beginning. i wanted 2 firewoods and  you could have the 2 waters and 2 foods. and yes firewood is  the most important for me,201,4
mturk_agent_2,What is second most important to you?,201,4
mturk_agent_1, the other two are  not important but  do we have a deal where i have 2 firewood and you have 2 foods and 2 waters?,201,5
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I would like to have 1 firewood, 3 water, and 1 food. If water and food are not as important to you, surely that will work?",201,5
mturk_agent_1,"yes, we have a deal. i agree,",201,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,201,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,201,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how are ya today? 🙂",202,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am doing great, how about yourself? 🙂",202,0
mturk_agent_1,Great...Thanks for asking. It's been so crazy in the world right now...A camping trip would be PERFECT!! A great escape.!,202,1
mturk_agent_2,I hear ya.  I could really use the food from the extra supplies a lot more than the other items.  I'm a little bigger than the average person.,202,1
mturk_agent_1,🙂🙂🙂Gotcha...no problems there...I'm more interested in staying hydrated..and water is more my supply of choice.,202,2
mturk_agent_2,I understand.  With the extra food I could also use some water more than the firewood.,202,2
mturk_agent_1,I see the food and water as the main aspects to the trip....it's nice out...the fire will be good...but not the biggest neccessity in my trip planning. I would like to just be comfortable..and enjoy myself.,202,3
mturk_agent_2,So I would get more food than you. You would get more water than me.  And what about the firewood?,202,3
mturk_agent_1,I would gladly take a bit more...just in case it does get cold?,202,4
mturk_agent_2,It might not get too cold but I could probably use it since I'm on a medication that tends to make me feel cold when it's actually nice out.,202,4
mturk_agent_1,I only get cold at night....when a fire would be super helpful....you could pack another heavier coat for the days...and then at night when I get cold...you would already have the jacket on and stay warmer.🙂,202,5
mturk_agent_2,"I guess that makes sense. 🙂 So more food for me, more water and firewood for you?",202,5
mturk_agent_1,🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂sounds wonderful...🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂,202,6

mturk_agent_1,"I would be willing to give you 3 waters if you will give me 3 firewoods. I'm actually worried about how cold it gets at night where we are going.

mturk_agent_1,"Okay I understand, I like to be cold I don't need firewood right know I prefer food and in this case some water",205,3
mturk_agent_2,"On top of that, I do need some water for medications. But, I have plenty of food.",205,3
mturk_agent_1,"I need food but not much because I alone with my wife, just need a little, I have more firewood and I need to exchange that",205,4
mturk_agent_2,"Great, I would appreciate the firewood in exchange for food. You are kind.",205,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,205,5

mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,205,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,205,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there! 🙂 I'm most interested in acquiring additional food packages because I plan on engaging in a lot of hiking which will require a lot of energy. So, could I offer you all of the water packages and I can have the rest?",206,0
mturk_agent_1,I also need more food. Can you please give me 2 food. I have more people than I initially budgeted for.,206,0
mturk_agent_2,"I will need food for my party as well or else we'll starve out there. How about if I give you 1 food package and 1 water package, and I'll have the rest.",206,1
mturk_agent_1,"That is not possible. I will give you 1 of food, water and firewood. I take the rest",206,1
mturk_agent_2,"I appreciate your willingness to work with me. 🙂 With that in mind, I will give you 1 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood. I will have the rest.",206,2
mturk_agent_1,That is unfair☹️,206,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm sorry you feel that way. ☹️ What do you prefer between the firewood and water?,206,3
mturk_agent_1,"Water. If I am giving you 2 food, I am taking 2 water and 2 firewood. or you can exchange yours for what I am taking.",206,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, if food is your biggest need I will be willing you give you 2 food, but then I will take just 1 food, 3 firewood and water and just live off the land. Would you prefer an option like that?",206,4
mturk_agent_1,We still need to share the other resources.,206,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok then I will take 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water. Deal?",206,5
mturk_agent_1,☹️ Ok then as you say.,206,5
mturk_agent_2,Great! Pleasure finding a compromise with you! 🙂,206,6
mturk_agent_1,Seems like we have a deal.,206,6

mturk_agent_1,Walk-Away,206,7
mturk_agent_2,How are you doing? Which items are you most interested in?,207,0
mturk_agent_1,I am most interested in the food packages,207,0
mturk_agent_2,Ok what if i were to give you all of the food? And you give me the water and 2 of the firewood?,207,1
mturk_agent_1,I am hoping to have 2 of the waters as I have diabetes and need the extra water for hydration frequently.  How about 3 foods 2 water for me and 3 firewood and 1 water pouch for you?,207,1
mturk_agent_2,"While I sympathize with your dilemma and definitely want you to have the water that you need, it would be unfair for you to get the 3 foods and 2 waters because those are the most precious resources. I’m pretty active myself and could use the extra food and water. I could do 2 foods for me 1 water and 2 firewood. Which would leave you 1 food 2 water and 1 firewood.",207,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, with you being active you need the water as well.  You originally offered 3 foods.  I will take the 3 foods.  You will need the extra hydration with your active style.  You should take the 2 water and firewood.",207,2
mturk_agent_2,Very true. I’m glad to see that we can compromise. However my original offer was for 3 foods for you and 3 waters for me. So how about 2 foods for you 1 water and 1 firewood. And I’ll take 1 food 2 water and 2 firewood. That should meet both of our needs 🙂,207,3
mturk_agent_1,I will pack my water purification set.  I will happily take the 3 foods and how about 2 firewoods?  ;),207,3
mturk_agent_2,Make it 3 foods and 1 firewood and you have a deal !,207,4
mturk_agent_1,You are killing me here.  I wish we could divide 1 item.  I will accept your offer.,207,4
mturk_agent_2,I agree wish we could split things up. Sending deal now,207,5

mturk_agent_2,"That is not ok. I have a medical condition where i need more water to stay hydrated, we also have a large family with a breast feeding mother. The firewood you can have all of",209,0
mturk_agent_1,"Well i'm diabetic and i'm worried about my blood sugar levels dropping to low. So how about i take 2 food,  and 3 firewood which would leave you all the water and 1 food.",209,1
mturk_agent_2,"You can have 2 food if i can have atleast 1 wood, then we can hunt but will need to cook more",209,1
mturk_agent_1,"Is there any chance i can have one water, if so then i agree to your deal.",209,2
mturk_agent_2,Nah its ok we can go with the first suggestion,209,2
mturk_agent_1,"are you talking about where i get 2 food, 1 firewood, and 2 waters. And you get 1 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water. Or are you talking about a different one?",209,3

mturk_agent_1,Then I got here and noticed I didn't pack my cooking sterno and critters go into some of my food☹️Kinda puts a damper on the trip.,21,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, i see. How about you get 2 food 1 firewood and 1 water. I need the extra firewood to stay warm at night",21,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, that should work. I brought plenty of water and the critters left that alone. You planning to go out on the trails at all?",21,2
mturk_agent_2,"I do have a little hike planned, so the water comes in handy. I am more excited to relax and fish",21,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well I want to go run the trail, but like to check it out first. Perhaps we could walk one together. perhaps in a couple moments we could fix the supply situation .",21,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, that would be fun. ",21,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well, why dont you propose how to divvy up the packages and we can get on with out camping?",21,4

mturk_agent_2,Hey! Nice to see a fellow camper!🙂,210,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi very nice to see you too.,210,0
mturk_agent_2,Man. Last night after we got here an animal got into our stuff and ate some of our food and damaged some of our water.😡. I am so mad at myself!,210,1
mturk_agent_1,Ok We will have deal on our needs.,210,1
mturk_agent_2,That would be great. I was afraid I might have to run into town and waste some of my down time. Thanks.,210,2
mturk_agent_1,Ok. What are the specific needs for you. You want only food and water right?,210,2
mturk_agent_2,"Don't need alot, but not needing fire wood at all. I can scrounge that from dead wood around my campsite. Did you have something in mind?",210,3
mturk_agent_1,Ya. I need all firewood. Because  mines are get wet. Shall I take all firewood and one bottle of water and one food.,210,3
mturk_agent_2,You are the man! I hope you don't take offense. Any more some words have meanings that I haven't kept up on. Sorry to hear that your wood got wet; that is a bummer!,210,4

mturk_agent_1,Hi! Hope you are having fun camping.,211,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I do enjoy camping, especially if I have plenty of water.",211,0
mturk_agent_1,Did you forget to carry water? Or did you bring too much?,211,1
mturk_agent_2,"I tend to get dehydrated very easily, so I need at least two of the additional packages of water.",211,1
mturk_agent_1,"I see. It so happens that the food we carried was accidentally left in the car and the food items have gone bad. If we can keep the food, you can have 2 waters.",211,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would like to do quite a bit of hiking.  I would like 2 water, 2 food, and 0 firewood.",211,2
mturk_agent_1,"well, that will not work for us. We have kids and we do really need the food. I hope you understand. We can try and make it with 1 water but we would need the food ☹️",211,3
mturk_agent_2,"it looks like we have a problem.  2 water, and 1 food only gives me 3 items.  I really don't need any extra firewood.☹️",211,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, you can still have a firewood. We can take 2 food, 1 water and 1-2 firewood. You can keep 2 waters, 1 food, and 1-2 firewoods. ",211,4
mturk_agent_2,"I guess that I can change my plans somewhat, and spend more time around the fire.  Maybe I can roast some marshmallows.  I could take 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood.",211,4
mturk_agent_1,Hmmm. We may be able to make that work ,211,5

mturk_agent_2,"Yes! I think it will be so much fun, and nice to get away. 🙂",212,0
mturk_agent_1,For sure.. I am just busy planning and getting supplies - do not want to forget anything. 😮,212,1
mturk_agent_2,"Most definitely! I have been making a list for a week. I am worried that my disability will make it difficult for me to get supplies once I get there, so I want to make sure I have all I need before we leave! ",212,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh yes, you want to be prepared. I am most worried about water because I get dehydrated easy and start getting ill - would be bad to have an emergency situation due to this.. What are your biggest concerns?",212,2
mturk_agent_2,"Water and firewood are my biggest concerns. My spinal cord injury will make it difficult to find both in the wilderness. You definitely need to have enough water if it makes you ill! How about I take one water and you can take two, but I'd like all the firewood. If I have to find water, I will not have the energy to gather wood as well. What do you think?",212,2
mturk_agent_1,Hmm. I think I can do that. Now what about food?,212,3
mturk_agent_2,"Since there is not an even number of extra food, I think that we should try to split it fairly. When I can drink a lot of water, I don't eat as much. Are you a big eater?",212,3
mturk_agent_1,I need to eat often but not big portions. However I do get grumpy if I do not snack every so often. I would like to have 2 food?,212,4
mturk_agent_2,I would be happy to let you have two of the food! I was thinking I would just need one. ,212,4
mturk_agent_1,"great, so I would take 2 water and 2 food, the rest is yours?",212,5
mturk_agent_2,"That seems fair to me, I would get one water, three wood, and one food. You would get the two water and two food. Does that sound like a good plan for you?",212,5
mturk_agent_1,yes,212,6

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,212,7
mturk_agent_1,Hello!🙂 I am going camping at Joshua Tree NP in very warm and dry conditions. We have a pretty large group.  I am looking to take the extra water and firewood. The evenings will be cool and there is not much wood there.,213,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi.. I can understand your concern. I'll be okay to share with you water packs.my area is covered by full winter. I need at least 2 pack of firewood.🙂,213,0
mturk_agent_1,"😮 Thanks for considering my water needs . . . I can see that the firewood would be important for you. I could give up two of the firewood to you, but that would be a problem.  We were planning to do some hunting and cook some of our food.  Without the firewood, I would need to bring more food.  I am willing to give you two of the firewood packages if you could leave the 3 food packages for me.  We have a large group and about one/third of them are college-age--they like and need to eat.🙂",213,1
mturk_agent_2,i'm happy to hear that you are considering my  need. I have 2 children in my house. I need at least ! pack of food to feed them. Kindly consider it.,213,1
mturk_agent_1,"I am willing to do that.  You can take two of the firewood and one food, and I will take the water, other firewood and 2 food packages. Do you agree?🙂",213,2
mturk_agent_2,"I need 1 pack of water, 1 pack of food, 2 pack of fire wood.  Totally i will take 4 packs.  You are going to take 5 packs.☹️",213,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think it is important to consider that it is about need, not just about evenness of distribution. You are going to be camping in wintry, snowy conditions where a lot of water is not needed.  I urge you to reconsider my offer. If you are just going with your immediate family, you should be fine.  I have over 20 in my group. ",213,3
mturk_agent_2,"if in this case, You take 3 pack of water and provide me 3 pack of firewood. Will this okay for u?",213,3
mturk_agent_1,What about the food?,213,4
mturk_agent_2,1 pack of food is enough for me. You take 2 pack. I think this will work for you.,213,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, that won't work for me.☹️ Without enough extra food, I will need more firewood.  My counter offer is to take the three waters and three food. I am running out of time, and if we don't work out a deal, then we'll both suffer.  Please reconsider.",213,5
mturk_agent_2,"Please consider. I'm ready to share  you 2 pack of food. 3 pack of water. I just need only one food. Without food, my children will suffer. That is the main reason. kindly consider it.",213,5
mturk_agent_1,"No, that won't work for me.  I will make a final offer or I walk away.  I will take the water, and two firewood, and you can take the food which you  and one firewood. That is my final offer or I will have to walk away.",213,6
mturk_agent_2,"☹️ Why suddenly changed your decision? As you already mentioned, I'll take 3 firewood. 1 pack water. You take other things. If this is not fine, let me know we'll come for an conclusion. ",213,6

mturk_agent_2,"I'm so excited! And we got an extra blessing this week. We had 2 foster kids placed with us so they will be joining us for the trip! They have never been camping before, so I am super pumped for them! 🙂",214,2
mturk_agent_1,Aww thats exciting! im bring my 5 month old for his first time so im excited about that!,214,2
mturk_agent_2,"Aww how fun! Love that! Since I have a few extra kiddos joining us, I am way short on food! I could really use 3 extra food packages!",214,3
mturk_agent_1,I can give you the 3 food if i can get 3 water and 2 firewood!,214,3
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you so much!! As much as that would help, It would also be super helpful if I could even get 1 water. I can get by with 2 firewood. ",214,4
mturk_agent_1,i really need the water for my babies formula!,214,4

mturk_agent_2,Just need a little more wood.  Then it will be great to cook my dinner on.,215,3
mturk_agent_1,I got some spare wood. I’m a little short on food though. I didn’t pack enough. ,215,3
mturk_agent_2,"Great, we can split the food, how are you on water?",215,4
mturk_agent_1,That would be great. I need to have frequent small meals throughout the day so the extra food would help. I have plenty of water. ,215,4
mturk_agent_2,"alright, so I'll keep the water, and firewood, and give you 2 extra food.  Does that sound like a good deal?",215,5
mturk_agent_1,I actually need one firewood and one food package. I can give you one water. ,215,5

mturk_agent_2,Water is important!! To me firewood is more important as I have anemia and I'm ALWAYS cold lol,216,2
mturk_agent_1,Alright. I have a  feeling we will have a deal then. How about you give me two water for a firewood?,216,2
mturk_agent_2,that sounds like a plan,216,3
mturk_agent_1,how many firewood you need? Maybe we could also exchange one food for one more firewood?,216,3
mturk_agent_2,"I would appreciate that, I was thinking of asking that! I would not require much in the way of extra food or water but the fire wood would be important!",216,4
mturk_agent_1,So I get two water for one firewood and one food for one firewood. So do we have a deal then?,216,4

mturk_agent_2,"That sounds like so much fun!  I hope we get to hike some.  I have my four month old baby with us which is exciting.  I'm worried I didn't bring enough water for his bottles, though.",217,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sucks, you need to be hydrated. What supplies do you require? My family loves to grill, so we do require food.",217,2
mturk_agent_2,Grilling is so much fun!  We left our grill at home so we can't really do that.  I will trade you some food for some water if you would like?,217,3

mturk_agent_2,"How about if I give you 3 food for 3 waters, and then we split the firewood?",217,5

mturk_agent_2,"yes there are 3 firewoods.  Okay I understand about the water.  then how about 2 foods for 2 waters, and we somehow divide the three firewoods? 🙂",217,6

mturk_agent_1,Hello. I would consider giving you 2 waters for 3 firewood and 2 food. I have a large family so the additional firewood will help with warmth and cooking food. 🙂,218,0
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like you could  really use the extra warmth for your family,218,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes it is very much needed. My family doesn't have a lot of extra bedding so having the warmth of a fire will help make sure we don't get cold at night 🙂,218,1
mturk_agent_2,Okay I am willing to take your offer as I think you need the firewood more than me and I could use the extra water for hygiene related issues.,218,2
mturk_agent_1,Thank you! I am grateful! ,218,2
mturk_agent_2,You are very welcome!,218,3
mturk_agent_1,I'm looking forward to this camping trip now knowing that we will have enough firewood to last🙂,218,3

mturk_agent_1,"My offer would be that I get 3 packages of water, 2 of firewood, and 1 of food.  I get dehydrated easily so I am constantly drinking water.",219,0
mturk_agent_2,I counter with I get 2 of each item and you get 1 of each item since I will be camping with my kids I will need more supplies,219,1
mturk_agent_1,I am camping with my boyfriend so 1 of each wouldn't be enough for us. I think food could be a problem for you guys so I think having all the packages of food would be fair. 🙂🙂,219,1
mturk_agent_2,"So how about we get 3 food, 1 water and 1 firewood and you guys 2 water and 2 firewood",219,2
mturk_agent_1,I would be fine with us getting 2 water and 3 firewood.  Your kids could help gather firewood quickly around the campsite.,219,2
mturk_agent_2,"LOL, true I think we can settle on that",219,3
mturk_agent_1,I think it is fair to both of us. 🙂,219,3

mturk_agent_2,"I'm doing great, thanks.",22,1
mturk_agent_1,How many of each supply would you like? what is your favorite?,22,2
mturk_agent_2,"I am flexible, but I would prefer some food and firewood.  I have a large family to feed and all of my food needs to be cooked.",22,2
mturk_agent_1,I also would prefer some food but am willing to give 3 fire wood in exchange for 3 water. I suffer from chronic dehydration because I sweat too much.,22,3
mturk_agent_2,"Excellent, I would love to help you out.  We have plenty of water to spare.  I'd gladly give you 3 water in exchange for 3 firewood.",22,3
mturk_agent_1,"Cool! To show my gratitude, i will give you the extra food. I will have 1 and you will have 2. Is that a good deal?",22,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, deal!  I get 3 firewood, 2 food, 0 water.  You get 3 water, 1 food, 0 firewood.  Thanks - have a great day!",22,4

mturk_agent_1,"I am good, how are you?",220,0
mturk_agent_2,Good thanks! I'm hoping we can find a good way to split some of these materials,220,1
mturk_agent_1,"I think we can definitely work something out.  How would you feel about taking 1 firewood, 2 water and 2 food? ",220,1
mturk_agent_2,"Maybe, but I think something closer to 1 firewood, 3 water, 1 food or 2 firewood 1 water 2 food would be better. do either of those work for you?",220,2
mturk_agent_1,"You could have 1 fire, 3 water and 1 food.  ",220,2
mturk_agent_2,"OK, that works for me! I should be able to use that. What are you most excited bout for yours?",220,3
mturk_agent_1,The firewood is what I am most excited for 🙂,220,3
mturk_agent_2,Nice! I'm looking forward to the trip and having a mix of resources,220,4
mturk_agent_1,Great! Enjoy!,220,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,220,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,220,5
mturk_agent_2,I am looking forward to this camping trip but I am concerned with not having enough water.,221,0
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, I can understand, I'm worried about food 😡.",221,0
mturk_agent_2,I could agree to let you have more food in exchange for me having more water.,221,1
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like a fair plan. I wish they had consulted us before sending everyone the same basic package, don't you? ",221,1
mturk_agent_2,"That would have been really helpful.  🙂 As far as the firewood, I could use more of that also. I tend to get cold easily.",221,2
mturk_agent_1,"I'm flexible on that, though I made the mistake of bringing a summer sleeping back to the mountains. A bit chilly, lol.",221,2
mturk_agent_2,"So how does 2 waters for me and 1 for you, 2 firewoods for me and 1 for you, and 2 foods for you and 1 for me sound?",221,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, if you get 2 firewoods, then I'll need all 3 foods as I'll have to search around for extra wood. Plus I was hoping to give some treats to my dog and they didn't include any in the supplies!",221,3
mturk_agent_2,"I realize with the odd number of extra supplies, there is no way to distribute equally.  I can't give up any extra food incase of emergency. Sorry.",221,4
mturk_agent_1,"Then I'll definitely need 2 food, 2 firewood, and just one water.",221,4
mturk_agent_2,I really need the extra water as I get dehydrated easily and I told you already about being cold.  I'm not trying to be disagreeable. These are things I really have to have.,221,5
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, but it is the same here. If dehydration is your biggest worry I can do 3 foods for me, and all three waters for you, with 2 wood for me.",221,5
mturk_agent_2,"I can't let extra food go.  I'm going to have to have 2 waters, 2 firewoods and 1 food.  This is where I'm at.",221,6
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, dear, I'm afraid this might be a failed trip then. I really can't agree to that. Too bad.",221,6
mturk_agent_2,Sorry to hear that.  We were so close.,221,7
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, too bad you caught me on a bad week - I got cheated out of a work bonus on Monday and now I'm not feeling very friendly/amenable. Bad luck for both of us, sorry!",221,7
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,221,8
mturk_agent_1,Hello - I am going camping and would like to bring additional food so that I can have variety in m diet,222,0
mturk_agent_2,I would also like some additional food for my camping trip. How are you feeling about extra firewood?,222,0
mturk_agent_1,I think I could be amenable to extra firewood. ,222,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I will gladly offer all 3 packages of firewood and 2 packages of water for all 3 packages of food. What do you think?",222,1
mturk_agent_1,"So you are proposing that you will keep all 3 food and 1 water, while I will get all 3 firewood and 2 water?",222,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that is my proposal 🙂",222,2
mturk_agent_1,Hmmm I like that proposal but I fear we may have reached a good solution too quickly. ,222,3
mturk_agent_2,"I agree. I thought for sure you would want some extra food lol. I do a lot of HIIT training, even in the woods, so I don't need much firewood but I get really hungry.",222,3
mturk_agent_1,You are right the woods are a great place to get more firewood. Not that i think of it I will be camping on the beach so I will be able to catch fish but might need more wood,222,4
mturk_agent_2,"Well, it would appear that we have an agreement so are we ready to submit our deal?",222,4
mturk_agent_1,looks like it,222,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,222,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,222,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello my friend! Are you ready for camping?,223,0
mturk_agent_1,I sure am! How about you?! 🙂🙂,223,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes. I love camping! But I am so hungry now. I did not get a chance to eat before coming here. I might need all extra food. ,223,1
mturk_agent_1,"I would really like to help you with that. I brought too many packages, and to be honest I like foraging for my food anyway, so I do need firewood.",223,1
mturk_agent_2,God to hear that! I don't really need firewood. I love cold. I can give you all if you give me the food.,223,2
mturk_agent_1,Yes I can absolutely give you all 3 of my packages of food for all 3 of your firewood! 🙂 That would make my day.,223,2
mturk_agent_2,That was easy. How about the water? I really hate drinking from the river..,223,3
mturk_agent_1,"I will let you have 2 if you want, I just need 1 for boiling.",223,3
mturk_agent_2,Oh thank you! Yeah.. we're going hiking after this so we probably need some water. ,223,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I love hiking. I'm just more of a Gatorade drinker. 🙂 I will be fine with 1 package of water.",223,4
mturk_agent_2,That's great! so I will get 3 food and 2 water. you will get 3 firewood and  water.,223,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,223,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,223,6
mturk_agent_2,Hey! How goes your outside adventure 🙂?,224,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, Well I'm getting ready for every stage. How many days do you plan to camp?",224,0
mturk_agent_2,"Just an extended weekend, but hope to get in some trail running and could use a little more water and maybe food.",224,1
mturk_agent_1,"I see, the water makes sense especially since it is essential for long trips. I guess you won't need much firewood",224,1
mturk_agent_2,"Maybe 1 as it is chilly at night up in the backwoods. I see there are three, would you like 2 of them?",224,2
mturk_agent_1,"It sounds balanced, since I plan to spend only 2 days camping since I want a relaxing weekend.",224,2
mturk_agent_2,"Planning on doing any fishing, or taking in a hike? If you want we could maybe explore one of the trails before I take in a run.",224,3
mturk_agent_1,"sounds good for another trip! Let's do this, I will give you all the water since I don't really need much planning to be near a river, but I do need food to avoid looking in the forest. I keep 3 food and 2 firewoods. you keep the rest, what do you think?",224,3
mturk_agent_2,"🙂 Sounds pretty good. I know some people can be tough negotiators, but time too is valuable. So perhaps soon we could arrange for 2 woods and 3 foods to you, 1 wood and 3 waters for me? Once we are done lets check out the trails!🙂",224,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds great to me, so let's do it that way. With pleasure like this I also get a little more experience in the wild",224,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello!,225,0
mturk_agent_1,"Good afternoon, I'm assuming it's afternoon where you are?",225,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes it is!,225,1
mturk_agent_1,"Excellent, so are you all prepped to go camping?",225,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I've been packing all day. I'm just waiting to add the extra supplies I need from our negotiation.",225,2
mturk_agent_1,"Same here, it's going to be extremely hot where I am so we have a need to have extra water.  Anything in particular you have a high need for?",225,2
mturk_agent_2,Water as well. I'm camping in the desert and there's no water source nearby. Do you have priority for any other items?,225,3
mturk_agent_1,"Food would be next up on my list, my kids are growing like weeds and always snacking.  What about you?",225,3
mturk_agent_2,"Food as well, haha. There's little wildlife around and I want to make sure I have some prepared. I'd be willing to give up more of my food packages for you and your kids, if I could have more of the water...?",225,4
mturk_agent_1,"So it seems as though we're in the same boat.  I'm somewhat tired of packing and have to get back to work so I'd be agreeable to something like that, or close to an even split.  Did you have anything specific in mind?",225,4
mturk_agent_2,"Hm, since you're giving up your high priority item for me you could have more overall. So I'm thinking 2 water for me, 1 food, and 1 firewood. And 1 water for you, 2 food, and 2 firewood. Thoughts on that? ",225,5
mturk_agent_1,That sounds completely reasonable to me.  I want to ensure we both have a great camping trip.,225,5

mturk_agent_1,Hi. I'm so excited to go on this camping trip. I will be going with my kids. How about you 🙂,226,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I am excited to go on this camping trip too! My kids convinced me to let their friends come so we have an extra person. I am a push over. 🙂,226,0
mturk_agent_1,Lol. That's nice. My kids have been looking forward to hiking during the camping and I would love them to have the best of it. So I will be needing more water due to dehydrated,226,1
mturk_agent_2,I see. There are no fresh streams anywhere nearby to run through my filter either. I would like to have at least one extra water for my group. ,226,1
mturk_agent_1,That's not an issue. I can spare one extra water for your group. My kids will be glad they got 2 extra water for the trip. ,226,2
mturk_agent_2,"Alrighty, sound good on the water front. I would like all the food since to feed my extra guest. I am not great at hunting.",226,2
mturk_agent_1,No problem about the food. My kids don't really eat much so I won't be needing any extra food. ,226,3
mturk_agent_2,Okay! :) How would you like to split up the firewood? ,226,3
mturk_agent_1,"Since you will be taking all the food , it would be fair if I get all the firewood. Remember I have kids who get cold easily. This will ensure they keep warm and stay healthy during the camping. ",226,4
mturk_agent_2,I understand and I want you and your family to stay warm. I can give you two firewood as I would need at least one to cook the extra food. I can't just feed my kidsuncooked food.,226,4
mturk_agent_1,That's understandable then. You can have 1 extra firewood. I will be good with 2 firewood,226,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,226,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,226,6
mturk_agent_2,"hello!  I would like to three of the food, two of the firewood, and one of the water.  you can have the rest.",227,0

mturk_agent_2,Food is my highest priority.  I really need three food.,227,1
mturk_agent_1,"would you be okay with 2 waters, you can never be too safe with water, specially when camping. more is better. as for firewood would you be okay with 1",227,1
mturk_agent_2,i would like to have two firewood and one water,227,2
mturk_agent_1,Are there any categories you are willing to work with me and compromise? find middle ground where we are both being taken care of and not just you?,227,2
mturk_agent_2,"ok i would take only one firewood and one water, but i still need three food",227,3
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you so much, would you be okay with 2 Food? what do you think? finding middle ground?",227,3
mturk_agent_2,how about i get two food and two firewood and one water?,227,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I will get 2 foods, 2 waters, and 1 firewood? did I understand right?",227,4
mturk_agent_2,"no you would get two water, one food, and one firewood",227,5
mturk_agent_1,Do you find that fair?,227,5
mturk_agent_2,that's what i need for my family's camping trip,227,6
mturk_agent_1,"I agree with you, I am also in need, as my family has much as valued as yours. i am willing to compromise if you give me 3 waters for the 2 food packages you want? do we have a deal ",227,6
mturk_agent_2,"no i can't give that up.  my final offer is you get two water, one food, and one firewood....take it or leave it, sorry to say",227,7
mturk_agent_1,"I am willing to give you the 2 packages of food for 3 waters, knowingly that I am sacrificing the security of my family in case something were to happen to them. ",227,7
mturk_agent_2,"no i'm sorry, it doesn't look like we can make this deal.  i am going to have to walk away.  unless you can accept two water, one food, and one firewood",227,8
mturk_agent_1,"I understand your stance and the need to safeguard your family. I will agree with you just because unlike like you, I care for the security of your family and not only think of mine. one food 2 waters and 1 firewood, correct?",227,8
mturk_agent_2,yes thank you for understanding,227,9

mturk_agent_2,pretty excited. you?,228,0
mturk_agent_1,"totally! so, let's try and divy these resources up. I feel I would need the most water, as I'm a big guy, and a bigger hiker. Extra water is a must for me. However, I don't need as much food, as I bring plenty for myself",228,1
mturk_agent_2,"cool. I can use 3 food, can I get 3 firewood and you can get 2 of my water",228,1
mturk_agent_1,"no, i'd definitely need wood for a bonfire, and food for rations. how does 2 food for you 2 fire for you and 1 water sound? while mine would be 2 water 1 fire, and 1 food?",228,2
mturk_agent_2,that's fair. I like that.,228,2
mturk_agent_1,"sounds good, so just confirming You: 2 food, 2 fire, 1 water. Me: 2 water, 1 fire, 1 food?",228,3
mturk_agent_2,that is correct,228,3

mturk_agent_1,hi i was wondering if i could maybe get 2 of the water since i left half of mine at home☹️ and you could take 1 water if you need? does this sound ok?,229,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm sorry ☹️. I brought my dogs so I would need 2 bottles for me. You could have 1. I would give you all my firewood since I would not use it.,229,0
mturk_agent_1,okay that sounds wonderful i broke my leg and am only camping with kids so they cant help me gather firewood so it is ok if i take all three firewood? so kind of you!,229,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes of course, you can have all of it. 🙂",229,1
mturk_agent_1,"ok, so what do we think about the food? do you need any food at all? what are your thoughts? lets come to a good compromise!",229,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds great, I would want all the food. Would hope that you can manage with some food of your own, I guess this would not be a difficult task. I cannot cook so any pre-packaged food would be good for me and my dogs.🙂",229,2
mturk_agent_1,what kind of dogs do you have? do they eat a lot? i know small dogs tend to eat less so maybe all the packages could be too much for u guys,229,3
mturk_agent_2,"I do have a poodle and a yorkie and maltese mix. The poodle is standard size, that baby eats a bit!🙂 I guess I would also need extra food since I would be cutting my own firewood and that would mean I would need to hike a bit.",229,3
mturk_agent_1,the dog i grew up with was a toy poodle!! they are such cute and smart pups!!!! i wish i had a standard poodle now. i have a boxer and hes a silly nut! i understand why you need extra. i was just trying to at least get two for my trip for the kiddos. we had some kids join last minute and i definitely dont have enough to feed them all. ,229,4
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry to hear, however too many can jeopardize the trip. It can also be dangerous to bring so many kids since any of them could get sick or worst scenario that would get into some kind of trouble. If I were you I would not bring such large group. I definitely need all the food given since it has been a while that I do not camp or have a vacation so that is why I would love to bring my dogs along. ",229,4
mturk_agent_1,well i didnt have a choice to bring them but here we are lol. but could you at least give me one package of food?,229,5
mturk_agent_2,"I am sorry, I could give you an extra water and I keep 1. I do need the food and you do have a choice, you can just be honest to them and let them know you don't have enough food.I believe that too many people can definitely jeopardize.☹️",229,5
mturk_agent_1,okay that sounds like a deal. ill take all the fire ill take 2 water and you have all the food sound good?🙂,229,6
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds great, good deal! I'm sure we will have a lot of adventure in this trip.🙂",229,6

mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I'm willing to consider that. What's really important to me is the firewood. Since you'd be getting more packages of food for your proposal, I'd like to have all 3 packages of firewood.",230,0
mturk_agent_1,I appreciate you considering my offer. I will need just a bit of firewood to cook the meals. Would you consider taking 2 of the firewood packages and allowing me to have 1?,230,1
mturk_agent_2,"That is costly. 😮 But I think it's fair. However, since I'm getting less food, which is very valuable to me, I'd like to have 2 of the water bottles. Do you think that's posible?",230,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I can absolutely agree to you taking 2 of the water bottles and I would take 1.",230,2
mturk_agent_2,"So that would be 2 firewood for me, 1 for year. 1 food for me, 2 for you. 2 water bottles for me, 1 for you. Do you prefer any other arrangement?",230,2
mturk_agent_1,I think that we have a fair arrangement. Are you comfortable with the supply distribution?,230,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I believe I am. I believe that this is far.",230,3

mturk_agent_1,"Hey, Back this trip should be a blast. I hope to not have as many misqueots around this time. Well I could use some extra water and fire wood.I dont eat much when camping because of a digestive issue and lack of easy bathrooms",231,0
mturk_agent_2,"I could definitely spare some extra water as it has been very rainy and wet in the area I will be going to! I am not so sure how much firewood I can spare due to it being so wet in the area! If I give up all the water, could I get 2 of the firewood, leaving you with 1?",231,1
mturk_agent_1,"That seems fair if you are going to the extra wet area, and finding dry kendling can be hard if its been raining or is extra humid. How are you on food in that area",231,1
mturk_agent_2,"The food situation has me a little nervous.  I've been worried about how many small animals will be in the area due to the rising waters.  I hope some stuck around, but I will see when I get there.  I also read how a terrible disease is killing some of the vegetation in spots around where I will be going.  It is some sort of fungus that is coming up due to it being so wet.",231,2
mturk_agent_1,"eww, That is a very wet area. My area flooded last year and the laike go so high it flooded camping spots.even the fish were hard to find, mostly because they were so well fed with the bugs washing in the water. Food could be a issue for you",231,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes it might be.  Although I would really love to really test my survivor skills, I would like to err on the side of caution and take 2 if I you are alright with that.  I would be willing to give up all the water to make it most fair. 🙂",231,3
mturk_agent_1,"I wouldent want you to push the survival test that far with the water. even with a filter bottle or straw the lake water still has a lake taist and if it gets hot and the algie blooms you cant drink the water, its unsafe. I could go with two waters and one wood and one food and be okay",231,3
mturk_agent_2,If I have the extra firewood I feel comfortable with boiling it to be safe to consume. ,231,4
mturk_agent_1,That would be a good way to make sure it is safer. would you want all 3 wood then?,231,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes if I can then! I will let you have all 3 of the waters in exchange!,231,5
mturk_agent_1,I couldent take all the water and not feel guilty about it. Water is one of the most important things for survival,231,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,231,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,231,6
mturk_agent_2,I was thinking that maybe i could get two waters and you get one. I need more water because i forgot some at home. what do you think?,232,0
mturk_agent_1,I can give you two waters if you give me 2 firewood. I don't have firewood to cook food.,232,0

mturk_agent_1,hi! i am going on a camping trip with my 2 teenage sons and would like to have some extra food and water to make sure we dont run out while out in the wilderness ,233,0
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like fun.  Are you planning on hanging out at the campsite or hiking?,233,0
mturk_agent_1,"we were planning on doing a lot of hiking. Due to this we will need extra food and water, how about I take all the extra food and 1 of the water, you can have the rest? ",233,1
mturk_agent_2,"I also am planning on hiking a lot. I can give you 2 food, and one water if  you give me 2 firewood?",233,1
mturk_agent_1,"So i would take 2 food, 2 water and a firewood? that would work great for me! ",233,2
mturk_agent_2,"No, not exactly, but close.  I would give you 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood.  Does that work?  I know with teenagers the food is very important. ",233,2
mturk_agent_1,"it is but so is water, would you be willing to trade the firewood for the water, so i take 2 food and 2 water and you can have the rest? ",233,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that would work for me.   I really don't like to be cold.  If I don't sleep, there would be no hiking for me.  I  also enjoy having extra firewood to roast marshmallows and sometimes even invite other campers i meet to join me for a meal.  ",233,3
mturk_agent_1,"OOH smore's that sounds good, sounds like we have a deal - i will take 2 food and 2 water you get 1 food 1 water and 3 firewood! ",233,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I would love to get your preference? ",234,0
mturk_agent_2,"hello, i am going to a camping trip soon and could use more water and possibly firewood as well",234,0
mturk_agent_1,I would also love to have some extra water. How many firewood would you like? ,234,1
mturk_agent_2,"i need the water so i'll be keeping that, but i will trade you 3 food for 3 firewood. it can get pretty cold at night.",234,1
mturk_agent_1,"I cannot agree to that because i also need water. I am willing to sacrifice my need for food and give to 2 food and i water, and keep 2 water and only 1 food. You can also keep 2 firewood. ",234,2
mturk_agent_2,i get pretty thirsty a lot otherwise my mouth gets very dry. if i don't get the water i'll just walk away from the deal,234,2
mturk_agent_1,"If you walk away it is bad for both of us. Therefore, we should come to a agreement for the benefit of both of us. ",234,3
mturk_agent_2,"that is how important water is to me, take or leave",234,3
mturk_agent_1,"I must must have at least 1 water, 3 food and 2 firewood. ",234,4
mturk_agent_2,i'll counter that with 1 water 3 food 0 wood or 0 water 3 food 1 wood. if not i am walking away.,234,4
mturk_agent_1,"I will need some firewood to boil water so i don't sick when i drink water. Therefore, i would need 1 firewood at least. I will take 1 water, 3 food, and 1 firewood. My last offer.",234,5

mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,234,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,234,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi! Hope you are enjoying your time outdoors. ,235,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi!  So far so good.  It's been pretty hot.  I hope you are enjoying it as well.,235,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, it is always fun camping with the family. But I heard that the weather is going to get very cold this evening.",235,1
mturk_agent_2,Same here.  I love camping.  I'm looking forward to the trip.  I enjoy the nights when they get chilly.,235,1
mturk_agent_1,We normally do as well but it so happens we are not carrying any firewood and could not find any at the stores close by. Now we are kinda worried.,235,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh no.  That's a shame.  I'm a little concerned about firewood as well.  I was hoping to be able to grab some.  I don't know if I have enough to get me through the trip.,235,2
mturk_agent_1,We don't have any unfortunately and we have kids with us. I hope you understand ☹️,235,3
mturk_agent_2,I absolutely understand.  I have kids as well. It's pretty ridiculous that the store is out of firewood 😡.  What is your plan?,235,3
mturk_agent_1,Well we can take 2 and you can take 1 in case you absolutely need it. Else we can take the firewood if thats okay.,235,4
mturk_agent_2,I could consider that.  I'm worried about running out of firewood.  Would you be willing to send over 3 of your waters if I gave you 2 firewood?  ,235,4
mturk_agent_1,I will be willing to give you 2 waters if i get 2 firewoods. We can do with 1 water I think but we will need at least 1 water,235,5
mturk_agent_2,Ok.  So 2 firewoods for 2 waters.  That works for me.  And we can agree that we are both good on food?,235,5
mturk_agent_1,how many foods would you need?,235,6
mturk_agent_2,I would need one from you at most.,235,6
mturk_agent_1,"Okay. So I take 2 firewoods, 1 water and 2 foods and you take 1 firewood, 2 waters and 1 food. Is that okay?",235,7
mturk_agent_2,That works for me.,235,7
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,235,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,235,8
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there, what are you looking for?  I really need extra water and food.",236,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello. I prefer food but firewood is important. I wouldn't want us all to get cold.,236,0
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, sound good.  Would three packs of firewood be good to you if I can get 3 things of water and two food?",236,1
mturk_agent_2,That actually doesn't sound too bad. I could use the firewood to make us cozy. One food to tide us over. ,236,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I have a pretty big appetite, and plan to do a lot of hiking, so the food and water would be well used by me.",236,2
mturk_agent_2,Absolutely. Everyone looks for different things on a camping trip. I'm glad our needs seem to intersect.,236,2
mturk_agent_1,"So, what is the final deal we are striking here?",236,3
mturk_agent_2,"3 firewood for me, 1 food, no water. 2 food for you, 3 water for you, no firewood?",236,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that sounds good to me, looks like we have a deal.",236,4
mturk_agent_2,That sounds great. Thanks!🙂,236,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,236,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,236,5
mturk_agent_2,I would really like 2 packages of firewood and 2 of food. But I can do with one package of water. ,237,0
mturk_agent_1,Okay I can agree to 2 of the water.,237,0
mturk_agent_2,I already don't drink much water so I can get away with 1. 🙂 I am worried about not having enough food because I am pregnant. ,237,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you all 3 of the food, if you can give me 2 of the firewood because I am going somewhere really cold and need the wood to make fires.",237,1
mturk_agent_2,I would worry about you not having any food! I am always cold and feel like I will be freezing and lose to much body heat if I don't have enough firewood. ,237,2
mturk_agent_1,"I am not worried about food, I have plenty but I need at least two of the firewood for where I am going.",237,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm not sure how to make that work. ☹️ I wonder if the extra food would help keep me warm?,237,3
mturk_agent_1,You would still have one of the firewood but a good amount of food since you are pregnant. Perhaps you could bring warm soups or cocoa.,237,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that might work! Maybe my extra fat will keep me warm! 😮",237,4
mturk_agent_1,"So we can do 3 food for you, 1 water, 1 firewood, and 0 food for myself, 2 water, and 2 firewood?",237,4
mturk_agent_2,I would be happy with that if you think you will be okay with it! 🙂,237,5
mturk_agent_1,Yes,237,5
mturk_agent_2,Thank you so much. It has been a pleasure dealing with you. I hope you have a great trip!,237,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,237,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,237,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, Do you think I could have all firewood, water and food? I have 6 students do camping with me tonight.",238,0
mturk_agent_2,Sorry but my family and I (my partner and 3 children) are going on a hike so we would need more supplies. How about instead you take all the water and we take all the firewood and food?,238,0
mturk_agent_1,What is your priority for this supplies?,238,1
mturk_agent_2,"I think we mostly need firewood, but we're also a bit short on food since the hike is nearly twice as long as we anticipated. What supplies do you need?",238,1
mturk_agent_1,We do need firewood the most and some of water and a bit of food.,238,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds like a pickle we find ourselves in. How about this, I take all 3 packages of firewood and compromise by giving you all 3 packages of the water, and also give you 1 package of food. ",238,2
mturk_agent_1,"How about you can have 1 water, 1 firewood, 1 food and we will have 2 firewood, 2 water and 2 food?",238,3
mturk_agent_2,"I fear we may not come to an agreement as this rate ☹️ My hike will be up a very open mountain so if we are to start and maintain a fire we really need a lot of wood otherwise the winds will really just tear it down and we'll freeze. You said you were bringing 6 students so I think water and food is most important for you. So here's a good deal, how about we take all of the firewood and 1 package of food, and you take 2 packages of food and all the water?",238,3
mturk_agent_1,We must have firewood for our camping as our students need light from firewood to cook our food and do activity in the camp. ,238,4
mturk_agent_2,I'm willing to swap 1 of the firewood packages for 1 of the food packages then. Gonna need energy for that hike.,238,4
mturk_agent_1,How about we take 2 firewood and 3 water and you can have all food and 1 firewood?,238,5
mturk_agent_2,"I'm afraid I need at least 2 firewood packages otherwise the winds won't let us even start the fire much less maintain one. How about we take 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water?",238,5
mturk_agent_1,okay. we would do this deal.,238,6
mturk_agent_2,"Alright great, it's a deal then! 🙂",238,6

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,238,7
mturk_agent_1,hi,239,0

mturk_agent_2,"I could also use some water. Would you like to take 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood of the extra supplies?",239,1
mturk_agent_1,"yes,A better thinking in the managed to the extra supplies.",239,2
mturk_agent_2,Firewood is my lowest priority item since I think I brought plenty.,239,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok,I lowest supplies in the firefood.",239,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, how about you take 2 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food?",239,3
mturk_agent_1,A managed sharing in the better ideas.,239,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello there.,24,0
mturk_agent_1,hi,24,0
mturk_agent_2,So I plan to go hiking a lot this trip and I would appreciate a majority of the water and firewood if possible.,24,1
mturk_agent_1,I want to go on hiking too. Since I don't go alone I need food and water.,24,1
mturk_agent_2,I would be willing to sacrifice the majority of food in exchange for water and firewood.,24,2
mturk_agent_1,This offer is good for me but I need some water too. Can we share the water and have all the firewood? 🙂,24,2
mturk_agent_2,"No, I offer you 3 food, and 1 water.  I would like 2 water and 3 firewood.",24,3
mturk_agent_1,Well this is perfect for me. I agree with 3 food and 1 water. Do you also agree?🙂,24,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sure that sounds fair to me, we both get what we need.🙂",24,4

mturk_agent_2,"How about I get 2 food packages, 2 firewood packages, and 2 water packages?",240,0
mturk_agent_1,I disagree with that offer.  That gives you way more than me.,240,0
mturk_agent_2,Okay. I agree 🙂 How do you think we should share it?,240,1
mturk_agent_1,"I would like 2 foods, 2 firewood and 1 water. 🙂",240,1
mturk_agent_2,I do have my 9 year old daughter with me and I need to make sure she has enough food. Could you get by with 1 food?,240,2
mturk_agent_1,No I really need 2 foods because I have a disease that make my immunity lowered when I don't eat right.,240,2
mturk_agent_2,I completely understand! We both need to stay safe. I can get by with 1 water because I have a water filter with me. I can always go to the stream to get more.,240,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay then I agree to take 2 water then.  How about the firewood?.  I have been sick lately and really need to stay warm.  I really need 2 firewood.,240,3
mturk_agent_2,I am worried about my daughter being warm at night. I would be okay probably but I want her to be warm.,240,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well then if you take 2 firewood, then I want 2 food. Is that alright?",240,4
mturk_agent_2,The two firewood would make me feel better. And I can make do with 1 water. And you can have the 2 food because of your illness. Does that work for you?,240,5
mturk_agent_1,Yes that sounds like a deal.,240,5
mturk_agent_2,"Let me make sure - - I get 1 food, 2 firewood and 1 water. You get 2 food, 1 firewood, and 2 water. Is that it?",240,6
mturk_agent_1,yes that is it🙂,240,6

mturk_agent_2,Hello! Are you excited for your camping trip coming up?,241,0
mturk_agent_1,I am super excited!! its going to be awesome 🙂 i see we have some packages we can split. the first thing i notice is there is food available! i was wondering if i could take all 3 ? ,241,0
mturk_agent_2,How about you can have all the food if I can have all the water?,241,1
mturk_agent_1,Is there any way i could have all the food and just 1 water at least? I bought my friends dog last minute and completely forgot to pack her some water? what do you think? im open to discuss? But YES all 3 food is great for me,241,1
mturk_agent_2,"If you're going to do that, then I need 2 water and all three firewood. I feel like I'm really getting the stick of the deal otherwise.",241,2
mturk_agent_1,oh i understand why you would feel that way. is there a reason why you would like all 3 water?,241,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm going camping in an exceptionally hot part of California (daytime temperatures are like 100F+) and I'm opting to not take too much food for that reason. The nights get rather cold, so I need some firewood, but I can deal with cold nights more than thirsty days!",241,3
mturk_agent_1,WOW your brave for camping in that heat. im in upstate new york for camping so maybe i can find a stream for pup to drink from. im okay with giving you all the food and ill have all the water. what are we thinking for firewood?,241,3
mturk_agent_2,One or two is fine with me. Since you're in NY will there be natural wood/trees for you use potentially? There won't be too many where I'm at.,241,4
mturk_agent_1,there are some woods but i broke my leg last week and im taking my kids and i dont trust them to gather wood alone. so is it possible for me to have 2?,241,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes! Let's do it. I think that's a fair trade. I'm just going with myself, so 3 water for me, 1 firewood for me, the rest to you is fine.",241,5
mturk_agent_1,okay so we have a deal? i get all food you get all water. i get 2 wood you get 1? NICE thanks so much and i hope you have a fun trip!! stay hydrated,241,5

mturk_agent_2,"I am planning on bringing my family on the trip, and both of my sisters are currently pregnant, so they are hungry all the time. I think I could use quite a bit more food for my trip.",242,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh dang, I'm looking for food too! We're camping in a pretty dry, desolate place with little food source, so we need to be prepared. Maybe to try and be fair, I could give up more of the food for you if I could have more water in return. ",242,1
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like a good idea. Water is pretty filling. ,242,2
mturk_agent_1,"ha ha ha, that's funny :) So maybe I could give you two food, and I'll keep one. And I can have the water to make up for the lost food? What is your status on firewood?",242,2
mturk_agent_2,Well I will need one water. So I think 2 food for me and 2 water for you.,242,3
mturk_agent_1,"I'd be fine with that, then I think I will need 2 firewood, because I only have one food and will need to cook whatever I can manage to find. ",242,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok. That sounds good.,242,4

mturk_agent_1,"I'm bringing water, firewood, and food. How about you?",243,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, me also. I need some things more than others, and I need to do some trading. 🙂",243,2
mturk_agent_1,I need water and firewood mostly. What do you need?,243,2
mturk_agent_2,Firewood for sure! I don't need water really. I sterilize well and stream water.,243,3
mturk_agent_1,Are you willing to make a trade with me?,243,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, please. Would you like to have all of my water? 🙂",243,4

mturk_agent_2,How about your firewood? Do you need all of it?,243,5
mturk_agent_1,"I need firewood. I will give you 1 firewood, and 1 food package for your water packages. How does that sound?",243,5
mturk_agent_2,"I really need more than 1 firewood. I go through it really quickly, especially with sanitizing my water.",243,6
mturk_agent_1,I need firewood to keep me warm at night and to cook my food.,243,6
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, so if you need more than 1 firewood, I'll take 2 food, and 2 water?",243,7
mturk_agent_1,"I thought you didn't need water? I give you 1 food, 1 firewood for your 3 water packages. How does that sound?",243,7
mturk_agent_2,"I just want to make sure the trade is fair. There are 3 of each, so how about this.. for you 1 firewood, 1 food, 3 water and for me 2 firewood, 2 food, 0 water.",243,8

mturk_agent_1,"It is a 3 for 3 deal. I give you 1 firewood, 2 food. You give me 3 waters.",243,15
mturk_agent_2,But in the end you have 7 items and I have 2.,243,15
mturk_agent_1,Can you do math? I'm giving you 3 items. You give me 3 items. It's a fair deal.,243,16
mturk_agent_2,"I can. With my deal I have 2 firewood and 2 food, and 0 water, which equals 4. You have 1 firewood, 1 food, and 3 water. That equals 5. How do you like my math?",243,16
mturk_agent_1,I will trade you my 2 Food + 1 Firewood for 3 of your Waters. Accept this or I will walk away.,243,17
mturk_agent_2,"You don't understand how this works. I can help you. We have to split 9 items. You can have 5, I will take 4.",243,17
mturk_agent_1,Show me your deal,243,18
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,243,18
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,243,19
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you?!",244,0
mturk_agent_1,pretty good! I happened across a little puppy when I was hiking and he seems adorable. so out of these extra supplies what do you need more of? ,244,0
mturk_agent_2,"For me, it's food. I have diabetes and need food whenever I feel a sugar low happening. How about you?",244,1
mturk_agent_1,Water for me. I am taking some antibiotics and other meds so need extra water,244,1
mturk_agent_2,I would happily give up an extra water for an extra food and firewood,244,2
mturk_agent_1,"well I do need a little extra food so I can give this puppy a nice full belly.  You could take 1 food, 3 fire wood if i could have 3 water and 2 food. would that work for you?",244,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds great!,244,3
mturk_agent_1,"okay so just to clarify and make sure we are on the same page, i would get 3 water and 2 food and you would get 1 food and 3 firewood? I like deals where we both come out ahead",244,3
mturk_agent_2,ok,244,4
mturk_agent_1,sounds great! I am glad we could both benefit from out  deals :) enjoyed meeting you ,244,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,244,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,244,5
mturk_agent_1,"I am looking forward to my upcoming camping trip, but I will need a few more supplies. How about you?",245,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes!  I will need some too.  I am hoping we can come to an agreement on the limited supplies.,245,0
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I have a child who will be quite thirsty after running around the campsite, so water will be important to us. ",245,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, that makes sense!  I am pregnant and will mostly need firewood since I will be staying a few days longer than anyone else. ",245,1
mturk_agent_1,That makes complete sense. I am fine with you having more firewood.,245,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh thank you!  You are so kind!  I am glad to give you all the water you need since I will be camping near a stream and can collect and purify the water from there.,245,2
mturk_agent_1,"Perfect! When it comes to food, what are your needs?",245,3
mturk_agent_2,"I would prefer to have 2 portions, since I will be extra hungry eating for 2.",245,3
mturk_agent_1,I think that sounds reasonable to me. ,245,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, so then I would get 2 portions of food and you would get 1?  🙂",245,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,245,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,245,5
mturk_agent_1,hello,246,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello I need more firewood to cook food and make fires. Would you be able to give me 3 packages of firewood?,246,0
mturk_agent_1,"i will give 1 pack of fire wood, 2 pack of water, 3 pack of food",246,1
mturk_agent_2,"How about 2 packs of firewood, and 1 pack of water, and 2 packs of food?",246,1
mturk_agent_1,"sorry i will give 2 pack of firewood, 1 pack of water, 1 pack of food ",246,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok I accept that deal,246,2
mturk_agent_1,ok thank you have a good day,246,3
mturk_agent_2,Can you accept that deal through here? ,246,3
mturk_agent_1,yes i will accept that deal,246,4
mturk_agent_2,OK please and thank you,246,4
mturk_agent_1,yes accepted,246,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,246,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,246,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you?",247,0
mturk_agent_1,Good how are you! 🙂,247,0
mturk_agent_2,"Pretty good, looking forward to the camping trip.",247,1
mturk_agent_1,Me too. Can I ask you to be considered of the food. I have a lot of people with me so I really need lots of food. We have tons of firewood on the other hand so that is not an issue. ,247,1
mturk_agent_2,Yeah I need a lot of food too. I have an ax to chop down wood for fire.,247,2
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, ok. My second need is water. Would like to split it this way? You get 2 foods, 1 water, and 1 firewood?",247,2
mturk_agent_2,I would like to have more water if I give up more food. There is not a lot of natural water sources around.,247,3
mturk_agent_1,how would you like to do it?,247,3
mturk_agent_2,I can give you all the firewood for another water.,247,4
mturk_agent_1,ok we can do that.,247,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,247,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,247,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you?",248,0
mturk_agent_2,I am doing well. How are you? \,248,0
mturk_agent_1,Doing ok. Just gathering all the stuff we need for the camping trip this weekend. It's going to be my kids' first so they're looking foward to it.,248,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm so happy to hear that they are looking forward to a good time. I am also looking forward to the trip with my family. I would like to have additional food and water packages to make our trip better. What are the things that you would like more of? ,248,1
mturk_agent_1,Unfortunately I also need food and water as well. My kids are diabetic so they need to have a stable amount of food and water for their medications.,248,2
mturk_agent_2,How about I provide you with 2 packs of water and I will take 1. For the food maybe I can have 2 and you can have one? ,248,2
mturk_agent_1,"They need food more than water to keep their levels constant. I am willing to offer 2 packs of water, 1 food and 2 firewood?",248,3
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good to me. ,248,3
mturk_agent_1,ok appreciate your understanding. I'll be able to send over a proposal shortly,248,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I hope that your kids stay healthy and happy during your trip.",248,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,248,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,248,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello. I hope you are doing well. Me and my young family, along with our grandparents are going on a camping trip. My father and husband are diabetic, so we would like to have all three food to make sure if their blood sugar gets low we can regulate it. ",249,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I hope you are doing well too",249,0
mturk_agent_2,"I would like to have all of the three food for my diabetic family members, and two firewoods to keep my family warm during the cold evenings. ",249,1
mturk_agent_1,"I understand you need all the food, but I would like to have all the firewood and water for my group of friends",249,1
mturk_agent_2,I totally understand that. So if you're willing to give me three food I would be willing to give you three firewood. ,249,2
mturk_agent_1,Yes you can have three food packages while I get 3 firewood packages,249,2
mturk_agent_2,Perfect 🙂 Now I would like two waters as we plan on hiking a lot and so I would like some extra for my family.,249,3
mturk_agent_1,Hmm my friends and I are also planning on hiking and kayaking and we want to make sure we have plenty of water. I think we need at minimum two packages,249,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay. Well I would be willing to just have one extra of water then in order to compromise, and in return would like to have one firewood if that would be okay.",249,4
mturk_agent_1,I would really like to keep three firewood packages. Is there any way I can get the 2 waters?,249,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay. Yes that will work then. I will take three food, and one water, and you can have two water and three firewood. 🙂",249,5
mturk_agent_1,Okay that works great. Thank you for the compromise,249,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,249,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,249,6
mturk_agent_1,"I would like to ask for 3 firewood, 1 water and 0 food. I will be in an area where no extra wood will be available and I need the wood to cook all the food that I will already have.",25,0
mturk_agent_2,I understand where you're coming from but I'm afraid that is not acceptable.  My family's comfort is my top priority and I will be needing at least 2 firewoods to make sure they are kept warm.  I would also request some extra water. ,25,0
mturk_agent_1,I need a minimum of 2 firewood. You can have 2 water. I would now like 2 food.,25,1
mturk_agent_2,"It seems we both have a big need for firewood. 😮 If you insist on 2 firewood, then I insist on getting 2 water AND 2 food along with 1 firewood.",25,1
mturk_agent_1,I insist on 2 firewood 🙂. I would be happy to let you have 2 water. Are you sure you need 2 food?,25,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes. If I'm letting you have more firewood (of which I would like to have more) then I'm going to need more of the other supplies. 🙂,25,2
mturk_agent_1,I would be ok with this situation.,25,3
mturk_agent_2,"So I would get 2 water, 2 food and 1 firewood?",25,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes that is what would work best for me.,25,4
mturk_agent_2,Then I think we have a deal.,25,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,25,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,25,5
mturk_agent_2,HI!! Hows it going? are you as into camping as I am?,250,0
mturk_agent_1,I love to camp. I love a good campfire at night to make smores and sing around. 🙂,250,0
mturk_agent_2,"I know thats right-  I used to really look forward to starting the fire, and cooking on the open flame-",250,1
mturk_agent_1,We just got back yesterday from a 5 day trip to the lake. We had a campfire almost every night. We took lots of water to drink also. I would like to have at least 2 waters and 2 firewood.,250,1
mturk_agent_2,"Thats dope- The thing is, we plan to cook with the firewood, so I really need what I have.  I was thinking I would need at least 2 or 3 myself.  Water isn't as much of an issue- we have a filter, and tablets if that breaks.",250,2
mturk_agent_1,I understand needing it to cook with. It does take a lot of food when you go camping to fulfill those calories you burn when hiking.,250,2
mturk_agent_2,True that- what is it you are going to be doing? What do you really think you need?,250,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I could probably live with 1 Firewood just for the evening. I would like at least 2 water. How much food do you think you would eat? Are you a pretty hungry person? 🙂",250,3
mturk_agent_2,"I am a former chef- I am always snackin on something- I could maybe live with 1 food and 1 water, but I need a lot of firewood going into this trip...",250,4
mturk_agent_1,Where do you like to camp? Will you be in the woods with more firewood?,250,4
mturk_agent_2,"We are going to medicine bow national park, most of our trip is going to be a site in the snowy region, which is above the timberline.  We are making a base camp, then taking day trips to different climbing, and hiking attractions.",250,5
mturk_agent_1,"We will be near the water, but there are lots of trees around and I can get more firewood. I would be fine with 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 2 food to keep me happy. 🙂",250,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,250,6
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,250,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,250,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,250,7
mturk_agent_1,"I would love to have extra firewood, i am bringing my family and camping in cold weather🙂",251,0
mturk_agent_2,I can negotiate with that but I would like additional food.,251,0
mturk_agent_1,"I think that will work great, I love hunting and think you could use more food.",251,1
mturk_agent_2,That's fine I don't get to cold at night so I don't mind giving additional firewood.  I can get some insulated sleeping bags.,251,1
mturk_agent_1,"ha perfect, how would you feel about having 3 food, 2 water, 0 firewood?",251,2
mturk_agent_2,I would need at least 1 package of firewood just in case of a major temperature drop.  You can have the majority of what I have.,251,2
mturk_agent_1,"ok would you do 3 food, 1 water, 1 firewood?",251,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes I can do that sounds great.,251,3
mturk_agent_1,"sounds like we have a deal i will submit for me getting 2 firewood, 2 water, 0 food",251,4
mturk_agent_2,It's a deal then great negotating with you!,251,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,251,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,251,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello I would like at least 2 of the waters because I will be camping in a very hot area and be doing some hiking. 2 foods because I have a couple friends that can not afford their own. Also 1 firewood so that I can cook the food.,252,0
mturk_agent_2,"I think we can come to an agreement on the food and firewood, however I would like 2 waters for the same reason.",252,0
mturk_agent_1,I will give you 2 waters If I can have 3 firewood.,252,1
mturk_agent_2,I'll only give you 3 firewood if I get 3 waters and 1 food.,252,1
mturk_agent_1,well I surely do need some water more than I need 3 firewood.,252,2
mturk_agent_2,"Keep in mind, this for extra supplies.  We get a basic set by default.  How about I take 2 waters, 1 firewood, and 1 food.  That gives you 1 water, 2 firewood, and 2 food.",252,2
mturk_agent_1,I do know it is for extra supplies. Another reason I am asking for the 3 firewood is there will not be extra wood to cut around my campsite. ,252,3
mturk_agent_2,What do you feel is your highest priority item here?  I consider water to be most important to me.,252,3
mturk_agent_1,Water is by far for me. Considering the 100 degree weather and hiking I will be doing.,252,4
mturk_agent_2,"In that case, I'll give you 2 waters but then I want 2 firewood and 2 food.",252,4
mturk_agent_1,"How about I have 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood.",252,5
mturk_agent_2,"No, I've already given you the better deal.  Take 2 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood or I will walk away.",252,5
mturk_agent_1,I believe the deal I just gave you is more fair for both of us. Also walking away is not a good idea.,252,6
mturk_agent_2,"If we assign a point value of 3, 2, and 1.  You are getting 6, 2, and 1 (9 points).  I am getting 3, 4, and 2 (9 points).  My deal is a fair deal.  Your deal leaves me with 7 points.  So I say again, You can have 2 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood.  That is equal point value.",252,6
mturk_agent_1,alright I accept.,252,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,252,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,252,8
mturk_agent_1,Hi.  I'm most interested inteh firewood during this negotiation.  Do you have any preferences?,253,0
mturk_agent_2,"I really need food--that is my first preference.  I also need firewood.  We will be cooking a lot of our own food, and, it will be cooler temperatures up in the mountains.🙂",253,0
mturk_agent_1,I can understand the need for firewood if you will be in a cool climate.  I will as well.  Food is not very high on my list of needs.,253,1
mturk_agent_2,"Would it be okay if I took the food, then, and you can have all the extra water and 1 extra firewood?",253,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can very easily give you all 3 of the food packages without issue.  But, I was hoping for 2 of the firewood in exchange.  🙂",253,2
mturk_agent_2,"Water is not a high priority, but I suppose you could take the second firewood and I could take 2 of the waters instead.  Since we will be hiking a lot, a little extra water would help.",253,2
mturk_agent_1,"That would be great.  I'm camping in an area where finding wood fire the fire would be very difficult, but there is a stream close by so I can definitly negotiate with water for the extra firewood.",253,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds like a deal:  I will take the food, one firewood, and two waters, and you can have the rest. Ready to submit?",253,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes.  I really apprecaite your workingwith me.  I agree to giving you 1 firewood, 2 waters, and all 3 of the food if that's agreeable.🙂",253,4
mturk_agent_2,You are welcome.  YOu have deal.,253,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,253,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,253,5

mturk_agent_2,well am interested in extra water only ,256,1
mturk_agent_1,OK. Maybe I could take the 3 foods and you can have all 3 water?,256,2
mturk_agent_2,no i will take 2 water 1 food and 1 firewood,256,2
mturk_agent_1,"that sound good. 🙂 So I'll have 2 foods, 1 water and 2 firewood You'll get 2 water 1 food and 1 firewood. Is that right and acceptable to you?",256,3
mturk_agent_2,"yes am satisfied with it, cause the weather here is really hot",256,3
mturk_agent_1,I think we're almost ready to end this negotiation. Where are you camping at?,256,4
mturk_agent_2,at dry tortugas national park and you?,256,4
mturk_agent_1,Yosemite. Have a great time! 🙂,256,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,256,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,256,6
mturk_agent_2,hi! i am taking my kids on a camping trip to teach them there is more to life than ipads and phones! i am very excited it should be a great time! ,257,0
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, you are a great parent. Good luck! So what do you guys need in terms of extra packages?",257,0
mturk_agent_2,"I really need some extra firewood some water and a little food - maybe 2 firewood, 2 water and a food? ",257,1
mturk_agent_1,"My big need is firewood. I need light at night to study for my medical boards. If it works for you, how does two each of food and water, with me getting all the firewood? I hope I do not sound selfish! ",257,1
mturk_agent_2,"Medical Boards, Congrats! I am really wanting to do some fires with my kids, so how about i take 1 of the firewood, 2 water and 1 of the food? I want them to have fun so that they want to do this again and i can keep them occupied minus the screens ",257,2
mturk_agent_1,That is very fair of you. Thank you. How many littles are traveling with you? I am camping with my very quiet bestfriend. We both need to slow down but remain alert!,257,2
mturk_agent_2,i have 2 boys around 10 - and with no school at the end of last year they are just needing something special. Can we trade camping partners for a night - quiet sounds SO nice! ,257,3
mturk_agent_1,LOL. I would love that! You deserve at LEAST one peaceful night. So you are find with one each of firewood and food and 2 waters?,257,3
mturk_agent_2,yes that works just fine for me - unless you want to pass 1 more food this way  with 2 boys i will never turn down food 🙂 ,257,4
mturk_agent_1,I am so happy about getting extra light that I am happy to give you guys 2 foods. You are an awesome parent!,257,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,257,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,257,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, excited for the camping trip?",258,0
mturk_agent_2,Oh yes.  I have been looking forward to this trip for a while.  How are you?,258,0
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, just trying to plan everything! 🙂",258,1
mturk_agent_2,I know. I really don't want to forget something I will need.  Have done that in the past.,258,1
mturk_agent_1,Me as well.. What are you biggest concerns? I am afraid to run out of water as I dehydrate a lot and start feeling sick. I can go longer without food but water is crucial. ,258,2
mturk_agent_2,I agree water is crucial.  How about if I take 2 waters and give you 2 food and 2 firewood.  I usually bring food that doesn't need a lot of cooking so firewood is not a priority for me.  It's only me and my son so I know we'll have enough food. ,258,2
mturk_agent_1,I was hoping to get 3 waters. But I could do 2 waters - as I mentioned - I start feeling sick and dehydrated but food I do not consume that much and skip my meals a lot. Firewood would not be needed for food for me but more for keeping warm and having light when it is dark..,258,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think I can give you 2 waters as you mentioned your dehydration condition.  I know from a family member that some people get dehydrated much faster than others. If you could give me 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood, I think we can have a deal. I will try and find a natural source of water and boil it on the fire for safety before drinking.Does this deal work for you?  ",258,3
mturk_agent_1,"What about if I give you 1 water, 3 food and 1 firewood?",258,4
mturk_agent_2,"One water will work. As I'm thinking about my choices, extra food with my teenage son may be just what we need to avoid meltdown.  I accept your offer. ",258,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,258,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,258,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I need lots of firewood and food - is water important to you?",259,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, how are you?  Food is important to me, but so is water.",259,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm good.  Hope all is well and safe with you as well.  Yes, firewood is important to me because I need it to cook the fish and meat that we brought on the trip.",259,1
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, that makes sense! I can let you have more, or most firewood.  I need some amount of both food and water though.  We don’t have enough of either.  ☹️",259,1
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good.  I can let you have more of or the most water.,259,2
mturk_agent_1,That seems like a good deal.  I can probably get by with just 1 food if i can have 3 water.,259,2
mturk_agent_2,Sure.  Would I be able to have 3 firewoods?,259,3
mturk_agent_1,Could i have 1 firewood so we can be warm at night?,259,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sure.  That works.  So I get 2 firewoods, 2 foods, 1 water?",259,4
mturk_agent_1,"Hmmm, i thought i got 1 food, 1 wood and 3 water 😮",259,4
mturk_agent_2,Oh ok.  That works too,259,5
mturk_agent_1,"Great, i’ll propose it",259,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,259,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,259,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, what a great time of year to go camping.",26,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes I can't wait! So sick of being stuck at home. 🙂,26,0
mturk_agent_1,"It will be nice to get out and explore the great outdoors, even if it is super hot!",26,1
mturk_agent_2,I agree. What supplies could you use more of?,26,1
mturk_agent_1,"Water for sure, need to stay extra hydrated.  How about you?",26,2
mturk_agent_2,Haha yup I had a feeling about that one. ;-) Yeah my wife has a bunch of crazy hikes planned so water is a must here too. What else?,26,2
mturk_agent_1,"Food of course, always snack more when relaxing.  Agree on the hiking.  Out in the woods, we won't have to wear masks!",26,3
mturk_agent_2,Well we don't want to make all the bears sick though haha. Okay so let's try this... one of us gets 2 waters with 1 firewood and 1 food. I think that's as close as we'll get to equal. You can choose.,26,3
mturk_agent_1,"awe, that's true,  Now I fell bad for the bears.  I'll take 2 waters and 1 food, you can have all the firewood.",26,4
mturk_agent_2,Okay that sounds great. Have fun!,26,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, hope all is well.  I need all the extra water.  I sweat more due to a condition so have to replenish fluids",261,0
mturk_agent_2,i'm not buying it.  I told you my horses need water to drink.  They are dehydrated and malnourished due to mistreatment.  I need all the extra supplies.🙂,261,0
mturk_agent_1," Not buying it?  I am insulted.  How about I take 2 water, and 2 firewood. You can have the rest",261,1
mturk_agent_2,I work for a nonprofit that supports a charity for the mistreatment of horses.  I would venture that you are probably someone that would be cruel to animals.  I think you are a bad person so I'm going to walk away and you will get nothing.,261,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I was told not to use profanity, so you are lucky that THEY TOLD ME NOT TOO",261,2
mturk_agent_2,Using bold text is the same as profanity.  I bet you voted for Trump too and are probably a white supremacist. 😡,261,2
mturk_agent_1,"Look, we are here to make a deal that is good for both of us. How about I take 1 water, 2 food and 2 fire wood.",261,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I'll take all the water for the poor starving horses and you can have 1 firewood and 1 food. 🙂",261,3

mturk_agent_2,Hello.  Great to see a fellow camper and hiker here this weekend.  How are you doing?,262,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm doing well. I love camping and hiking.,262,0
mturk_agent_2,"yeah.  My whole family likes it.  My wife, kids and mother-in-law are all here to.  They are getting trail maps for the hike.  I am trying to sort out what to do about the food and water we loss when the airline moss two of our bags with the supplies for the long weekend here.",262,1
mturk_agent_1,Will I can negotiate higher amounts of water.,262,1
mturk_agent_2,"I really need food, water and some fire wood.  With the family I really need 3 food and 2 water.  Can you accomodate that?",262,2
mturk_agent_1,I can give 3 packages of water and 2 packages of Firewood.,262,2
mturk_agent_2,"No that is no good for me I need some food how about 1 food, 3 water and 1 wood for me and 2 food and 2 wood for you?🙂",262,3
mturk_agent_1,I give more water than food.  ,262,3
mturk_agent_2,With the offer you get 2 food and I get 1.,262,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ok I think I can do that.  So just to clarify 1 package of food, 3 packages of water, and 1 package of Firewood for you.",262,4

mturk_agent_1,Ok that's great. Deal!,262,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,262,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,262,6
mturk_agent_1,Hey there friend.,263,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! How are you?,263,0
mturk_agent_1,I am fine. I am settling down in preparation for camping.,263,1
mturk_agent_2,Awesome!  Do you go camping often?,263,1
mturk_agent_1,No. This is my first time and I am anxious whether I have enough supplies. ,263,2
mturk_agent_2,"I understand that.  I camp quite often, so I can help you with any questions you have. Let's try to come up with a fair deal for the extra packages we can have.  I often get chilly due to some medications I take, so I would really like to have extra firewood.  Is there anything in particular you would prefer to have extra of?",263,2
mturk_agent_1,Firewood is also of priority for me. I am  afraid I will be a Popsicle if I do  not get more wood for the overnight fire. ,263,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can certainly understand that, no one likes to be too cold.  How about I'll make an offer, and then we can see where we stand in terms of what we think is fair.   What if I take 2 packages of the firewood and you take 1.  That way you can be sure to stay warm, and I won't need to worry for my health. In exchange for this you can have 2 of the food and 2 of the water and I will take one of each.  You'll end up with more extra supplies, than I will, but my health is my biggest priority here.",263,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds like a good deal to me,263,4
mturk_agent_2,Great!,263,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,263,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,263,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi there! What is the top item that you are looking for?,264,0
mturk_agent_1,I am looking for food.,264,0
mturk_agent_2,Ah I see 🙂I was hoping to get a lot of extra water and food because there will be a lot of people coming with us and we will be far away from all stores.,264,1
mturk_agent_1,You can have more water and i have more food.,264,1
mturk_agent_2,"Alright, I was thinking of taking 3 waters, would that work for you?",264,2
mturk_agent_1,You can have 2 waters and i have more food.,264,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hmmm, I'm not sure that would work for me ☹️ how many packages of food would you need?",264,3
mturk_agent_1,You can give me 2 food and you take 2 waters.,264,3
mturk_agent_2,I could manage that! What about the firewood?,264,4
mturk_agent_1,I will give you 2 firewood.,264,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,264,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,264,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I'd really like 3 water and 3 firewood. You could have all of the food, as I would rather not have a ton of it due to the risk of wild animals poking around my campsite. 🙂",265,0
mturk_agent_1,"I couldn't possibly give you all of the water. I have a baby, and I need to make formula for her. What if I take 2 of the water? ",265,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm afraid 2 of the water is too much. It's very hard to find potable water in the wilderness, so I need as much as I can get. I would be willing to part with a maximum of 1 water. ☹️",265,1
mturk_agent_1,"Unfortunately, I have the same issue of needing the water. I don't mind giving you all of the firewood, but parting with 2 waters would be very difficult.",265,1
mturk_agent_2,I'll let you have 2 waters if I can take all the firewood and food? 😮,265,2
mturk_agent_1,"i can't give you all of the food. what if you take all of the firewood, one water and one food?",265,2
mturk_agent_2,"If you're going to take the most of the water, which is the most important item for me, I feel it's only fair to have all of firewood, one water, and two food.",265,3
mturk_agent_1,you'd be taking 6 items and only leaving me 3. That doesn't seem fair.,265,3
mturk_agent_2,"The two waters alone are worth the most. But I'll concede -- I'll take the firewood, one water, and one food.",265,4
mturk_agent_1,That would work for me as well.,265,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,265,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,265,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello!  Can I get all of the extra water?,266,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey. Well, I actually need a good amount of water myself, because I nursing. Can I have a water and the extra food?",266,0
mturk_agent_2,Nursing? Wow!  That is great! Is your baby coming camping too?,266,1
mturk_agent_1,"No, she is staying home so I have to pump so I do not get clogged milk ducts. It's not too bad though because she is down to once a day yet I am still always hungry and the doctor said I need extra 'healthy' calories. So much for s'mores! lol",266,1
mturk_agent_2,"Nice!  I am on medically-prescribed, water-only fast right now because of my run-away high blood pressure, so water is all I can consume.  I am in the critical phase where my body is dumping excess sodium, and the success of my fast depends on how much water I consume.  I don't need the extra food though, so I can part with that.    ",266,2
mturk_agent_1,Oh wow. Do you also use meds to help regulate your bp? Camping will be great for getting away from stress which we both could probably use! have a water bottle that filters stream water so you take all the extra water and I will have all the extra food. Will you be okay with 1 firewood since you do not need to cook?,266,2
mturk_agent_2,"Not eating means my body does not burn food, so my body is very succeptible to the cold.  With your ""new Mommy metabolism"" I imagine you are a furnace right about now. Am I right? 🙂🙂",266,3
mturk_agent_1,"Mommy metabolism.🙂 Sure, I can always bring an extra sweatshirt and who doesn't like gathering branches and kindling? So shall we agree with you receiving 3 waters, 2 firewood units, and 0 extra food? 🙂",266,3
mturk_agent_2,"That works for me, as long you bring pictures of your baby to share!🙂🙂",266,4
mturk_agent_1,"That is so cute! She is on my phone and I have an extra battery unit, for emergencies! A momma can't be too cautious. It will be fun meeting you. Look into one of those water bottles with the special filter for river and stream water. ",266,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,266,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,266,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi As a starting point I just put in an initial proposal,267,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm unable to see your proposal. I'm hoping to get at least 2 additional packages of firewood. I forgot my sleeping bag and blankets, so extra firewood would help me stay warm at night. ",267,0
mturk_agent_2,I was hoping for two packages of firewood as well...I would need it to heat the food and water,267,1
mturk_agent_1,I would be willing to give you the 2 packages of firewood if I'm able to take all of the food and one water. My dog is coming on the camping trip and I'm worried with all the extra activity he won't have enough food and water packed for the weekend. ,267,1
mturk_agent_2,"I would need one food and one water in addition to the firewood. Alternatively, you can have 2 firewoods if I could have 2 foods and 2 waters",267,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would feel better about our trip if I was able to have 2 firewood 1 food and 2 waters. Is that something you would be interested in doing? I think I can make do on the food, but extra water for my pup would be ideal. ",267,2
mturk_agent_2,So if you have the extra firewood you can boil water at the campsite for your dog. I am a dog lover as well and want to be sure they are taken care of. I propose we set up a ratio of 2to 1 for firewood and water (if you get two firewood you get one water and vice versa) that seems they only way for us both to have something that we can work with,267,3
mturk_agent_1,I appreciate that you're a fellow dog lover. I hadn't thought about boiling water. A 2:1 ratio seems fair to me. ,267,3
mturk_agent_2,How about if the person who get the two firewood (which seems to be the most desirable entity) only gets 1 food and the person who gets the lesser valued water gets the extra food. That seems fair to me,267,4
mturk_agent_1,"I can agree with that. The firewood is my biggest concern because I forgot the blankets! As long as I'm warm, I should be able to make do on 1 food and 1 water. ",267,4
mturk_agent_2,"okay so I propose you get two firewood, one water and one food. I get one firewood, two food and two water. Do you agree?",267,5
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I agree. I'll submit the deal now.",267,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,267,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,267,6
mturk_agent_1,🙂,268,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, what are you looking for for the trip?",268,0
mturk_agent_1,i need waterm firewood and food,268,1
mturk_agent_2,"Likewise, but I want to be fair.",268,1
mturk_agent_1,what do you need most of,268,2
mturk_agent_2,"I need food the most, how bout you?",268,2
mturk_agent_1,i need the water,268,3
mturk_agent_2,"oh ok, so firewood is low on the list!",268,3
mturk_agent_1,correct ,268,4
mturk_agent_2,"How about I get the 3 food, you get the 3 water, and you get 1 firewood and I get 2 of them? ",268,4
mturk_agent_1,how about i get one food and you get 2 waters and then you can get 2 firewoods,268,5
mturk_agent_2,That sounds fair to me.,268,5
mturk_agent_1,"i mean you get 2 foods, 1 water and 2 firewood",268,6
mturk_agent_2,That's also fine with me. I'm flexable and want it to be cool,268,6
mturk_agent_1,sounds good ill go ahead ahd submit the deal?,268,7
mturk_agent_2,Sure 🙂,268,7
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,268,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,268,8
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I hope you are having a good day 🙂. I am in need of water for my camping trip, what item do you need the most? ",269,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi same here, hope your day was good. I'm really looking for firewood and food. Do you need food too?",269,0
mturk_agent_2,"I need water and firewood. I have enough food with me to be ok. However, the reason I need water is that I have never been able to go anywhere without having a lot of water just in case I get stranded. What do you need the most for your camping trip?",269,1
mturk_agent_1,Ah good to know. I'm in need of firewood and food- I really need firewood because it gets cold at night on the trip and I'm afraid to go without. As far as food goes that's self explanatory- can't go hungry lol,269,1
mturk_agent_2,That makes sense 🙂 . I also need firewood because I need to be able to cook my food. How many nights will you be camping for? ,269,2
mturk_agent_1,Totally makes sense. My trip will be for 3 days so I'm looking to get 3 firewood packages and 2 foods. I can however part with the water. How long is your camping trip?,269,2
mturk_agent_2,"My camping trip will also be for 3 days. I would be happy to get 3 water, and give you three food. However, I would like to get 2 firewood for my journey. I need to firewood so that I do not have to be in the dark. I am scared of the dark. ",269,3
mturk_agent_1,"I wouldn't be able to go without at least 2 firewood. You see, the area where I'm camping gets close to freezing at night and I need enough to wood to keep me warm at night. Check you basic pack you may have a flashlight in there 🙂 If you give me at least 2 firewood I could give you 1 food as well.",269,3
mturk_agent_2,"I have checked my basic pack and there are no flashlights 😮 . What if I were to get 3 water, 1 firewood and 2 food? That way at least I can eat if I get too scared. I have always been an emotional eater. That way you could get 2 sets of firewood and 1 package of food. ",269,4
mturk_agent_1,"Oh no, I could've sworn it had one. That would work for me though that would be enough for me to sustain I'll submit the deal.",269,4
mturk_agent_2,Sounds great. I agree to the deal. ,269,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,269,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,269,6
mturk_agent_2,Ireall would like the water as I forgot to bring it and would not be able to survive without it,27,0
mturk_agent_1,I can trade more food but I need a bit more water.  ,27,0
mturk_agent_2,"I do need the water as well, I can  trade more firewood.",27,1
mturk_agent_1,No I want need at least two packages of water.  I can give you two packages of food and all my firewood.,27,1
mturk_agent_2,Sorr I can give you 1 water only or I would not have enough for myself. ,27,2
mturk_agent_1,I can give you more food if you like but I really need the water,27,2
mturk_agent_2,"It seems we both need the water so If you want 2 water, I would need all the food and firewood as well.",27,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about this I give you 1 package of  water, 2 packages of food, and 3 packages of Firewood.  You get the majority of my items",27,3
mturk_agent_2,I guess that could work and seems pretty fair for all.,27,4
mturk_agent_1,Ok sounds like deal then.,27,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,27,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,27,5
mturk_agent_1,What are your preferences for additional supplies?,270,0
mturk_agent_2,"I could use water the most, you?",270,0
mturk_agent_1,I need more food.,270,1
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, I can make that work, how are you doing in regards to firewood?",270,1
mturk_agent_1,I need some firewood too.,270,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ah, then we are both in the same boat in regards to that.",270,2
mturk_agent_1,"We can split firewood. But I need most food because I have diabetics, I need sufficient food supply to stay healthy.",270,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, I'm willing to let you have all the food, if you let me have all the water.",270,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds good. I'll take 3 packages of food, and you can have all 3 packages of water.",270,4
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, and as for the wood, since there is only three I figure we should do a 2-1 split, although if you don't mind I'd prefer the 2- heard the camp area I'm headed to got cleared of most of its dead wood so there won't be much to find for a fire.",270,4
mturk_agent_1,"I'm wondering if I can get 2 packages of firewood. The local weather forecast says there's a 50% chance of rain, I'd need as much wood as possible to stay dry if it does rain.",270,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,270,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,270,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I would like to offer you 1 additional food package, 1 additional water package, and 2 firewood packages. Please let me know if this is a reasonable deal for your needs as well. 🙂🙂",271,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi!🙂 That does nor work for me. I'd like to take all packages of water and food. You can have the firewood. :) ,271,0
mturk_agent_2,"I can't accept that deal unfortunately. Our campsite requires substantial hiking with a lot of elevation gain. I will need the extra food and water to sustain the hiking. How about I take 2 food packages, 1 water package, and 1 firewood package. The rest can go to you. 🙂",271,1
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry☹️ I feel too thirsty and hungry. I need water and food. How about I take 3 water packages, 2 food packages and 1 firewood package. You can have the rest. ",271,1
mturk_agent_2,I just don't think that would be enough for me. ☹️ Surely we can come to a fair agreement that benefits us both. ,271,2
mturk_agent_1,How about you take 1 package of food and all packages of firewood?,271,2
mturk_agent_2,Why don't you tell me which of the 3 categories is most important to you? Maybe that will help us come to an agreement. 🙂,271,3
mturk_agent_1,"Water and food are most important to me. Can you please allow me to take all Packages of water, 2 packages of food and 1 package of firewood. ",271,3
mturk_agent_2,"I could allow you to take 2 packages or water, 1 package of food, and 1 package of firewood. ",271,4
mturk_agent_1,How about you take all 3 packages of firewood and 1 package of food?,271,4
mturk_agent_2,"That just doesn't seem fair. ☹️ If we don't come to an agreement soon I will have to walk away and then we both lose out. How about I get 2 packages of food, 1 package of water and 1 package of firewood? You get 1 package of food, 2 packages of water, and 2 packages of firewood. We will each get half of the items most important to us and you will get extra firewood. Seems pretty fair to me.",271,5
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, How about I take 3 packages of water. 1 package of food and 1 package of firewood. ",271,5
mturk_agent_2,"Nope, that does not work for me. I have to stick to my previous offer.",271,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, if we don't come to an agreement sometime soon, I'm going to walk away and it would be worse for both of us😡",271,6
mturk_agent_2,"I agree, and I'm sure we can come to a fair agreement. I need 2 packages of food, 1 package of water. You can have 1 package of food, 2 packages of water, and all of the firewood.",271,7

mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,271,8
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,271,8
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I'm willing to send you 2 packs of food. I don't need too much.,272,0
mturk_agent_2,"So if you’re planning on doing a ton of hiking/climbing while on your camping trip, then you’ll need a lot more food. I am  planning on doing a ton of hiking/climbing while on …",272,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm not going to do too much climbing. I'm just planning on kind of setting up camp and sitting tight. All I really need is a bunch of firewood.🙂,272,1
mturk_agent_2,"Not enough firewood will cut your campfire outing too short but too much firewood means less room in the car for packing other supplies. How Much Firewood Is In a Bundle? Typically, one bund",272,1
mturk_agent_1,Yeah all I really need would be 2 bundles.,272,2
mturk_agent_2,since that is all that is needed on your end than i will take the rest of the firewood ☹️,272,2
mturk_agent_1,that works for me! How much water do you think you'd like,272,3
mturk_agent_2," As we all know, water is a crucial part of our well-being and without it we simply would not survive. Drinking water ensures that we replace any fluids lost by perspiration and breathing, as well as helps to push out waste products from our bodies.",272,3
mturk_agent_1,Definitely. It sounds like you're doing a lot of hiking so you'd need some for sure. ,272,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, i need plenty of water for hiking🙂",272,4

mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, I need firewood as well. Also water. I can deal without eating that much",273,0
mturk_agent_2,"Food always seems like the one thing I go overboard with, I didnt realize how cold the weekend was going to be-",273,1
mturk_agent_1,haha same. 🙂 I just want to be warm at night for the most part,273,1
mturk_agent_2,Tent camping has its drawbacks- What do you have in terms of the quantity of firewood you would be willing to come off of?  ,273,2
mturk_agent_1,I only got 3 things of firewood. I'm willing to part with one of them. I'd give you 2 things of water and 3 things of food. I just want to be fair about sharing.,273,2
mturk_agent_2,"That is good to hear, fairness is important...Is there any way you would part with 2 bundles of firewood?  I really only needed 1 water- I would take 2 food in that case...🙂",273,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds fair to me,273,3
mturk_agent_2,"OK, so you can do 2 Firewood, 1 water, and 2 food?  ",273,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, we can both live with that. I'm not greedy. I just want everyone happy!",273,4

mturk_agent_1,Will be nice to set up a site and roast marshmallows over the camp fire.,274,1
mturk_agent_2,"That'll be fun, I just want to relax in the heat.",274,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm planning to swim in a nearby lake to cool off, then maybe do some fishing and cook the up what we catch on the campfire.",274,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm looking forward to grilling up some burgers and hot dogs.,274,2
mturk_agent_1,"Nice, so we will both be pretty hungry, we should split the extra food they are giving us.",274,3
mturk_agent_2,"OK, you can get 2 packages and I'll get 1?",274,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds great to me.  I'll need some extra firewood for all the campfire activities, so I'd like all of the wood.  You can have the water to keep hydrated.",274,4
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good to me.,274,4
mturk_agent_1,"Excellent!  Thanks for your negotiation, and enjoy your trip : )",274,5
mturk_agent_2,You too.,274,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,274,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,274,6
mturk_agent_2,hi there🙂,275,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello. I'm going camping and am in need of extra supplies. I hope we can strike a deal. 🙂,275,0
mturk_agent_2,Me too.  I need water due to a blood pressure condition that leaves me at high risk of having a stroke when out and about ☹️,275,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh goodness. I am in much need of water too. Are you sure that you should be out camping? Maybe a local hotel would be better for your condition.,275,1
mturk_agent_2,"I am along to spend at least some quality time with my grand children, even if it might be my last.  They are also ravenously hungry.  They grow up fast!",275,2
mturk_agent_1,"I have more wiggle room on the food, but not so much that I can give it all to you. I do have much need for firewood.",275,2
mturk_agent_2,"That is okay, we brought a lot of blankets.   Is your priority firewood?",275,3
mturk_agent_1,"My priorities are water, firewood, then food. I assume yours are water, food, then firewood last?",275,3
mturk_agent_2,That is correct. You can have all of the firewood,275,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay. What do you think of this split then? You will get 2 water, 0 firewood, and 2 food. Since I will get only one of my top priority item, but you will get two, I will have 5 items to your 4.",275,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,275,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,275,5
mturk_agent_2,Hey there!  Are you exited to go camping?,276,0
mturk_agent_1,yes i am ,276,0
mturk_agent_2,Awesome!  Would you mind sharing your highest priority items with me so we can come up with a fair deal?,276,1
mturk_agent_1,Im in need of Firewood,276,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I am in need of firewood too since it will be so cold tonight unfortunately.  But I would be willing to only accept 1 firewood if I can have 2 of water and 2 of food",276,2
mturk_agent_1,sorry i cant do that,276,2
mturk_agent_2,Why not?  That way you would get 4 packages in total and 2 of your most valuable ones.  I would get 5 packages in total but only 1 of my most valuable ones?,276,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay could you exchange me Food as well?,276,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about I get 1 firewood, 2 water, 2 food.  You get 2 firewood, 1 water, 1 food?",276,4
mturk_agent_1,okay thats a deal,276,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,276,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,276,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello Friend. I feel so excited about this camping trip. I've waiting for a long time to make this trip come true. How do you feel about it,277,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I'm also very excited! Let's make sure each of us has enough supplies to make it a good trip.,277,0
mturk_agent_1,Yeah. Sute,277,1
mturk_agent_2,I would love to have as much water as possible. I get dehydrated very easily.,277,1
mturk_agent_1,My kids will be hiking so I will need them to have enough water for the trip so they won't get thirsty. ,277,2
mturk_agent_2,How about firewood? Do you plan on having many fires?,277,2
mturk_agent_1,I really dont need the firewood. You can have all of them. As long as I have enough water and food to survive the camping trip,277,3
mturk_agent_2,"What if I take all the firewood and one water, you take 2 waters and all the food?",277,3
mturk_agent_1,It would be nice. I get 2 water and 3 food. You get the 3 firewood and 1 food. ,277,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that sounds like a plan!",277,4
mturk_agent_1,Yeah. A great one. Let's make a deal then,277,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,277,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,277,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I'm really interested in the firewood.  Not so much the food.",278,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, so am I. What were you thinking?",278,0
mturk_agent_1,So your top priority is firewood and your bottom priority is food?,278,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes,278,1
mturk_agent_1,"☹️ That's too bad, but I'm sure we can work something out.  Firewood is really helpful to me because I get really cold and can use it to cook food and boil water.  What about I get 3 firewood, and then you get 2 of the other two?",278,2
mturk_agent_2,That doesn't work for me. I need at least some of the firewood because mine got wet. I'm worried that the wood i do have won;t dry in time to be useful. ☹️,278,2
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, okay.  Well how about this instead.  You get 2 firewood, since that's your most desired and you want to dry your food (makes sense!), and then I'll take 2 water and 2 food, since I'm taking a haircut on the firewood.",278,3
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds like it could work. I wasn't too concerned with the water or the food. If you're sure, I'm willing to take your offered deal🙂",278,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I think that sounds like it works for both of us.  I can find a way to make do with less firewood.  The food and water can give me the energy I need to collect more.  I'll propose this offer next time or you can propose it now (if possible).",278,4
mturk_agent_2,"Alright, I can definitely make do with two firewood packages, 1 water package and 1 food package. Thanks for understanding!",278,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,278,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,278,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello 🙂, I think that I should get all of the food and water packages and you can get all of the firewood.",279,0
mturk_agent_2,Hey! Yeah that doesn't seem very fair. We can split the 9 packages a little more evenly. But I appreciate the suggestion. 🙂,279,0
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, how do you think we should split them? I would like most of the food packages though since I do not hunt or fish.",279,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I really need food too, but I'll just fish I guess, so, I'll take 1 food package, 2 water, and 2 firewood since I'll have to cook my fish.",279,1
mturk_agent_1,"What if I get 2 food packages, 2 water and 1 firewood, would that be an ok split for you?",279,2
mturk_agent_2,Not really. I do really need the food packages and I'm giving you 2. I think it's fair for me to have 2 water and 2 firewood since I'm giving you something I need.,279,2
mturk_agent_1,"I am going to need extra water too, how about I get 2 water, 2 food and you can have all of the firewood.",279,3
mturk_agent_2,No thanks. I feel like I am being fair enough with giving you 2 of my priority item. I'll take 3 packages of the food and you can have 3 water and 3 firewood.,279,3
mturk_agent_1,"That is fine , i'll take all of the water and firewood and you can have all of the food.",279,4
mturk_agent_2,That's a good deal. I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.,279,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,279,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,279,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, how are you?",28,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, i'm good.",28,0
mturk_agent_2,How are you preparing yourself to the camping trip?,28,1
mturk_agent_1,I am trying to gather supplies for the trip. What about you?,28,1
mturk_agent_2,I am also checking my list and updating it. How is your progress going?,28,2
mturk_agent_1,"Its good! I am looking forward to the activites i'll be doing, such as campfires.",28,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, that's great. Good to hear definitely. I am also looking forward to build some campfires and enjoy some s'mores!",28,3
mturk_agent_1,"Thats great! Would it be okay if I got 2 packages of firewood, and 1 each of the food and water?",28,3
mturk_agent_2,I would've like to have 2 packages of firewood instead. How about I give you all the extra water packages?,28,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well for a compromise I will give you the 2 packages of firewood, if I got 1 firewood, 2 food, and 3 waters. 🙂",28,4
mturk_agent_2,"Great, that sounds fair to me. ",28,5
mturk_agent_1,Okay! Great! Nice chatting with you! 🙂,28,5
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, have a nice trip!",28,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,28,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,28,7
mturk_agent_2,Do you have any prefrences?,280,0
mturk_agent_1,I would like to have extra food and water - I will collect firewood on site.  Which items do you prefer?,280,0
mturk_agent_2,"I would also like to have some extra food and i would also like to collect fire wood, I woudnt mind some extra water but it doesnt seem nessesary to me right now. Can I offer 1 food, 3 waters and a fire wood. you would get time to focus on other tasks instead of walking around for wood the first day. 🙂",280,1
mturk_agent_1,"I don't feel right about taking all of the water.  I can sacrifice some of the food but I have some blood sugar issues and need to eat to stay on an even keel.  How about as a counter offer I get 2 foods, 2 waters and only 1 firewood?🙂",280,1
mturk_agent_2,"I understand, I wouldnt want to disrupt your physical well being but we have an unexpected tag a long coming with us and were needing some extra food to accommodate them. We have the ability to fish onsite, would you possibly be able to stay with one food and accommodate the rest through fish? I would like to try but we are scheduled for group activities with little time to spend on the beautiful lake fishing? My counter is 1 food, 2 waters and 2 fire wood.",280,2
mturk_agent_1,I think you are making sense and I am starting to get where we are headed.  I think it is fun to have tag a longs so I don't want to make that harder.  How about 2 foods and 2 waters and then I forfeit all of the firewood?  With all that firewood you could have a big bon-fire. 🙂,280,2
mturk_agent_2,I didnt understand how much is going to me? If  I understood correctly I will be getting 2 foods 2 waters and 3 firewoods?,280,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry - did not mean to confuse - I was looking at getting 2 foods and 2 waters for myself.  You would end up with 1 food, 1 water and 3 firewoods.  ",280,3
mturk_agent_2,"☹️ I would like to keep working at this, is there an offer we can agree on that would leave me with two foods?",280,4
mturk_agent_1,"I can do that - I will go for 1 food, 2 waters and 1 firewood.  That will leave you with 2 foods, 1 water and 2 firewoods.  I feel good about submitting that deal.🙂",280,4
mturk_agent_2,"I also agree to that deal, thank you! I will submit it now!",280,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,280,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,280,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, hows it going?",281,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, good thanks! How bout with you?",281,0
mturk_agent_1,"Doing good, Hopping I can get some Food and Water",281,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm sure that we will be able to work something out 🙂,281,1
mturk_agent_1,Is their something your more interested in?,281,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm interested in getting more firewood and water.,281,2
mturk_agent_1,Okay well I dont really need any firewood. Could I take all the Food and you have All the Firewood?,281,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think that wood work for me, what do you suggest we do with the water?",281,3
mturk_agent_1,"Eh, im in a bit of a rush, so I can just take 1 and you can take 2",281,4
mturk_agent_2,Wow! That is very kind of you. I have a medical condition and have to stay very hydrated. ,281,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,281,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,281,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi! How are you doing today?,282,0
mturk_agent_2,Good!  How are you? ,282,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm good. We are negotiating today on water, firewood and food. Is that your understanding?",282,1
mturk_agent_2,That is.  I need the water because I have a heart condition that requires me to stay as hydrated as possible,282,1
mturk_agent_1,"I also need the water to stay hydrated. So, it appears we both will need water. How many waters do you think you will need?",282,2
mturk_agent_2,"I need at least 2 to stay on my feet, otherwise my condition could manifest ",282,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would be willing to give two waters. However, I may need concessions in other areas. What is your second highest priority?",282,3
mturk_agent_2,I also need firewood due to my poor circulation.  I am on a strict diet though so I do not need any additional food,282,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I also need firewood due to my health. The nights are very cold, and I don't want to get sick. Since I conceded two waters,  I would be willing to give you one firewood and keep two firewood for myself.",282,4
mturk_agent_2,what about the food?,282,4
mturk_agent_1,"I am really flexible on the food. So, I would be happy to give you whatever amount of food you need.",282,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,282,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,282,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello!,283,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello there 🙂,283,0
mturk_agent_2,Looks like we're ready to go camping. Have you thought about what supplies you prefer?,283,1
mturk_agent_1,I have! The one thing I'm worried about is if I have enough food so that's a big concern for me since I have a large family.,283,1
mturk_agent_2,I have the same concern as we are going to have a large group as well. We'll have to split the food somehow 2 and 1. What is your next priority?,283,2
mturk_agent_1,I'm more concerned about firewood since it's going to be cold when we go. What about you?,283,2
mturk_agent_2,That is my second biggest need as well. So well need to split that 2 and 1 as well. So I'm guessing water is not that important to you either.,283,3
mturk_agent_1,Not really. I just want to make sure I have food since it's my kids first time going and I don't want to hear them cry about being hungy.,283,3
mturk_agent_2,So I would suggest this as a compromise... You take the 2 food. Kids experience is very meaningful to me.  To be fair I'll take the 2 firewood and two water. so we end up with an even split where you get you more of the most important item and I get more of the lesser items. Does that sound fair? ,283,4
mturk_agent_1,So I'd get 1 water 1 firewood and 2 food? I think that will work. 🙂,283,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,283,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,283,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello i'm excited for this trip and was wondering if i could take 2 food, 1 firewood, and 2 water. That would leave you 1 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water",284,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm going to need either 2 or the water or 2 of the food.  you could take a second firewood for one or the other. ,284,0
mturk_agent_2,Can i ask why you need 2 more of the food or water?,284,1
mturk_agent_1,I am a diabetic and need to keep my blood sugar in order.  Is there a particular reason why you need two waters and two food? ,284,1
mturk_agent_2,I need 2 waters because i get really bad kidney stones if i don't drink enough water. ,284,2
mturk_agent_1,"What if I took all the food, you took all the water and 2 of the firewood? ",284,2
mturk_agent_2,"Not bad deal but could we do 1 food for me, 2 firewood and 2 waters for me, and you would get 2 food, 1 firewood and water?",284,3
mturk_agent_1,I think that would be fine with me. ,284,3
mturk_agent_2,🙂 Yes i'm so glad that we could come to this arrangement. I hope you have a wonderful camping trip.,284,4
mturk_agent_1,Thanks!  Best of luck to you too!!,284,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,284,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,284,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how are you?",285,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm well, how are you?",285,0
mturk_agent_1,"Im great, im so excited to go camping.",285,1
mturk_agent_2,"Me too, but it might get cold here.",285,1
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking the same thing, extra firewood would be great",285,2
mturk_agent_2,I have a lot of other supplies but think I need a lot of wood to keep the fire going.,285,2
mturk_agent_1,"How about water, will you be needing alot of that?",285,3
mturk_agent_2,"Nah, I think I'm good on water. You can have all of the rest if I could get some extra wood.",285,3
mturk_agent_1,"Wood is really important for me as well but i am ok with you getting 2 of those, if i get 3 waters and one food?",285,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, I could use that food. Thanks. That sounds like a good deal to me.",285,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,285,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,285,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello. What are your preferences for the extra packages?,286,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there! After reviewing how the weather has been in the area, I will be in a high need of firewood.  They have gotten a lot of rain, so all the wood I would scavenge for is probably too wet to use!",286,0
mturk_agent_2,"I understand. You can have 2 firewood packages, If I can have 2 food packages. I am in the early pregnancy months so the food is a high need for me.",286,1
mturk_agent_1,Congratulations to you!  I am willing to give you 2 of the food packages as I'm sure there will be a lot of fish in the stream nearby that I can fish for!  ,286,1
mturk_agent_2,Thank you! So you would have 2 firewood packages and 1 food package. I will have 1 firewood package and 2 food packages. Is that correct?,286,2
mturk_agent_1,Yes! That sounds great! Now what is your water needs??,286,2
mturk_agent_2,"I do sweat excessively, I often have issues with dehydration because of this. What are your water needs?",286,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well due to the high amount of rain the area has received and a stream nearby, I could let you have all 3 packages of the water.  I would then ask if I could have all 3 packages of the wood to make sure I had plenty to boil water with that is safe to drink. Do you think that sounds fair??",286,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes! That sounds fair and sounds like we have a deal. 🙂,286,4
mturk_agent_1,Great! I hope you have a great time on your camping trip! 🙂,286,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,286,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,286,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello! How are you?,287,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi how are you,287,0
mturk_agent_2,Good. Where are you thinking of going camping/,287,1
mturk_agent_1,I like going camping out in usual and popular camping sites,287,1
mturk_agent_2,Are you thinking the forest? Or the desert? Or wet places or dry places?,287,2
mturk_agent_1,The forest and you?,287,2
mturk_agent_2,I was thinking of going desert camping! I will definitely need lots of water to stay hydrated!,287,3
mturk_agent_1,Same here so how would you like to negotiate.,287,3
mturk_agent_2,Same here what? You just said you were going to the forest. Won't there be natural water available there?,287,4
mturk_agent_1,I like to carry extra water with me thats clean to,287,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,287,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,287,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I am a lifelong camper. My favorite part of camping is sitting by the fire at night. I propose 3 packages of firewood for me, 1 water and 1 food.",288,0
mturk_agent_2,"Camping's definitely something I enjoy a lot too, but I also love to cook and would want at least a little wood to make a nice meal. I'd also like to go hiking at least once while I'm out. What about 3 food, one wood, and one water for myself?",288,0
mturk_agent_1,"Well I need at least 1 food for myself. I'm very active, too. I love to hike and I imagine I would be very hungry. I need to replenish those calories.",288,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well remember that we both have enough food already for our trip, so this would just be some extra. Would it make you feel any better if I brought you some of the food I made? 🙂",288,1
mturk_agent_1,"In the era of social distancing, I would rather cook my own food, but that was very nice of you to offer. ",288,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, I definitely know what you mean there. It sounds like you're more active than me so I think we can definitely agree on you getting two of the water and me just getting one for now",288,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay let's agree to me getting 2 water and you getting 1 water. As for the firewood, it is really important to me to get 3. Camping is my life. My parents took us camping all throughout my childhood. We loved sitting around the fire together at night and having a good time. My parents have since passed on and I really need the extra firewood to keep this tradition and memories alive. 🙂",288,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry for your loss ☹️. I can respect wanting to keep them in your thoughts with a roaring bonfire or three while you're out, but are you going alone? I'm going with a group of four so there's going to be at least someone there that will also want a bigger fire one night even if I don't.",288,3
mturk_agent_1,"I will have 3 people with me. My son, my sister and her daughter. So okay, how about I take 2 firewood, 2 water and 1 food?",288,4
mturk_agent_2,I think that's pretty agreeable for covering our bases; though if your kids are young I could see you not needing two extra containers of water since you're probably not going on any short hikes. The food and fire seems respectful to both of our needs 🙂,288,4
mturk_agent_1,My son is 15 and my niece is 13. They are athletes. We will be doing hiking and biking. We will be needing the extra water.,288,5
mturk_agent_2,"Alright then; We were focusing more on canoeing with a bit of hiking on the side so I suppose I'll cede you the extra water. If it sounds good to you I'll submit my deal of 2 food, 1 water, 1 firewood now.",288,5
mturk_agent_1,ok i think that is fair,288,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,288,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,288,7
mturk_agent_1,Hi there.  I'm looking for some water and firewood.,289,0
mturk_agent_2,"Howdy! Water and Firewood. Looks like someone left 3 foods, 3 waters, and 3 firewoods. Perhaps we can split them. I need food because of a raccoon.",289,0
mturk_agent_1,Pesky raccoons!  I tend to get dehydrated so extra water is essential for me.  A bit of extra firewood is always good to keep warm and get the smores made.,289,1
mturk_agent_2,"I really dont need any firewood so perhaps you could have all the wood, and I could have the food splitting the water 2 for you and 1 for me. Sound good ?🙂",289,1
mturk_agent_1,I definitely don't mind giving you all the food since I'm dieting lol but maybe one more water so 2 for me and one for you?  I have a bad habit of getting dehydrated ☹️,289,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok! Thought thats what I wrote, but no harm no foul. Up for a hike after we get this taken care of? Its a little early yet.",289,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds wonderful to me!  Can always do up some food and smores afterwards!  Although might best if you cook the food, unless you like to eat charcoal lol :D  Also yes I do apologize I read that incorrectly!  There's that dehydration lol ",289,3
mturk_agent_2,"Cool. 🙂 So do you do any running? Would like to do some trail running, but need to check out the trails first. ",289,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ungh I am nowhere near enough in shape to run, unless something is chasing me, but if that is the case then I shall valiantly stay behind on the trail to defend you while you run 🙂",289,4
mturk_agent_2,"Well, valiantly eh? Ok. I guess I only need to out run you when the bear chases us. Some idiot in Europe got too close to a bear for a selfie. Too funny. ",289,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ohhh no!!  That doesn't sound like a very bright idea.  I doubt you'll have any issue outrunning me!  So before I forget, again, 2 water to me, 1 to you, I get all firewood and you get all the food?",289,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,289,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,289,6
mturk_agent_1,Hey there! I'm assuming you enjoy going camping?,29,0

mturk_agent_2,Me too. I am not good at hunting or fishing. So I generally try to take extra food,29,2
mturk_agent_1,"Haha I suck at those activities as well. I don't usually don't eat a lot, so I'm happy to exchange some food supplies for water supplies. ",29,3
mturk_agent_2,I would be willing to do that. What do you propose?,29,3

mturk_agent_1,Would you be willing to share 1 food?  I'm going to need some.,290,3

mturk_agent_1,"Indeed, but I can think of a few ways to make it better- think we might be able to agree on a deal?",291,1
mturk_agent_2,Of course!  I think we can make it work.,291,1
mturk_agent_1,How about you let me know what you're most in the market for?,291,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sure!  I'm looking to obtain 3 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water.  My family and I thought we had packed enough food but it turns out we did not bring enough.  Same goes with the Firewood, we are short two days worth of fire to last us for the entire trip.   We only need 1 water just in case for emergency. I hope you would be open to accepting my request.  =)",291,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well tell you what, I can give you the 3 food and 2 firewood easily, but on my end I don't really have any water to spare- I reckon I wouldn't even be able to give you 1.",291,3
mturk_agent_2,"You know what I think we can make that work.  Thank you for your understanding.  We'll take 3 food, 2 firewood, and no water.  That way you have what you need for water.  How does that sound? 🙂",291,3
mturk_agent_1,Sounds good to me! I believe we have ourselves a deal then.,291,4

mturk_agent_2,Hi. What do you expect from me?,292,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello. I am hoping to take 3 of the firewood, since I have a small baby and need to heat their milk.",292,0
mturk_agent_2,I would like to share 2 firewood with you. Because my place is so cold. I want at least 1 firewood for me. ,292,1
mturk_agent_1,"OK. Wouldn't want you to be cold, you can take 1 of the woods. 🙂  What about the food?",292,1
mturk_agent_2,I would share 1 food for you. Because my child and my wife want to food.,292,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds good to me, I'll take the 1 food.  How are you for water?",292,2
mturk_agent_2,I like to share with you 1 water. Because I live only drink water.,292,3
mturk_agent_1,Would I be able to take 2 of the waters? The water I packed for the trip was stolen as I was loading the car. I can give you all 3 of the food since my mother inlaw gave us enough food to last us a month. 🙂,292,3
mturk_agent_2,"Water is important for me. Because I have kidney problems and I drink less water, they affect my health.",292,4
mturk_agent_1,"☹️That's a shame. I'll give you 2 water.  So do we have a deal with you getting 1 firewood, 2 waters and 2 food?",292,4
mturk_agent_2,"I will give you 1 water, 2 firewood and 1 food.",292,5

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I would like to get as much firewood to cook my meat and as much food so I can have more of a variety of things to eat as I can.",293,0
mturk_agent_2,"I understand completely what you mean, however I do have young children in my group and could really use the firewood to keep them warm and safe, also we will need to cook food. I hope you can understand where I am coming from 🙂",293,0
mturk_agent_1,"I do understand, having an infant and a 7 year old myself.  We don't want to get too cold at night.  Do you have enough water?",293,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes we do have enough to drink, but not so much to clean ourselves.Do you have enough water ?",293,1
mturk_agent_1,"We have a little bit, enough to last a couple days.  We were planning on cleaning ourselves in the lake though.  Are you excited for the trip?",293,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes very excited 🙂 maybe the kids more then me as this is the first time they will be going camping. I am curious how many people will be camping in your party?,293,2
mturk_agent_1,"we have 6 people camping with us, my family and then my parents as well.  How about yourself?",293,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well I am taking my children as well as my neices and nephews so a total of 8, all kids just me 1 adult",293,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yikes, you are in for a handful.  What kind of food did you bring for everyone?",293,4
mturk_agent_2,"I was thinking of easy kid friendly stuff smores, hotdogs and sandwiches and chips. easy to serve and make.",293,4
mturk_agent_1,"We have a lot of food, but its almost all meat that I would need to cook.  What if I gave you 2 food packages, 2 water, and 1 firewood?",293,5
mturk_agent_2,"I really need firewood the most, as i don't have a way to bring extra or chop any, i would be willing to give you 1 firewood, 1 food, 3 water",293,5
mturk_agent_1,"What giving you 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water?  I'm thinking I'll have to not bring as much meat with less wood to cook and the extra food would help feed the adults.",293,6
mturk_agent_2,"i'm sorry but i have to think of my kids, i am willing to give 1 firewood, 2 food, 1 water..how does that sound,",293,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,293,7

mturk_agent_1,hi,294,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! How are you doing? Are you excited to go camping?,294,0

mturk_agent_2,Great! Where are you going?,294,1
mturk_agent_1,to New Jersey,294,2
mturk_agent_2,"So what are you going to need the most of? If I know correct, New Jersey is near the ocean (the shore, etc).",294,2
mturk_agent_1,"yes, I will need alot of food and some water. I need food to survive and water to drink",294,3
mturk_agent_2,"My highest priority is also water. If I get two water and one food, are you okay with two food and one water?",294,3
mturk_agent_1,"if so, then i will need all the firewood",294,4
mturk_agent_2,How about two firewood for you and one for me?,294,4
mturk_agent_1,can I get 1 more food then? my child needs the food,294,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,294,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,294,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi! What are your preferences for the packages?,295,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello its good to speak with you today🙂. My first priority is firewood, second is water. How about you?",295,0
mturk_agent_1,"Same here so it looks like we're in the same boat. I would really like to take all 3 firewood, as I'm going to a high altitude. I would be willing to give you 2 waters though. Does that work?",295,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well if you take 3 firewood, give me 3 waters. We'll split the food since we have the same priority.",295,1
mturk_agent_1,That doesn't work for me. Let's try to come to an agreement where we both get a bit of all three items.,295,2
mturk_agent_2,Okay. Why don't we each get two of everything and then split the rest.,295,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry I'm not sure I understand, since there are only three packages available of each item. Do you mean we each get one firewood, one water, one food, and negotiate the rest afterwards?",295,3
mturk_agent_2,"No. We each get 2 firewood, 2 water and 2 food (total of 6). There would be 1 of each left (total of 9 overall). We would split the remaining 3 - 1 water, 1 firewood and 1 food.",295,3
mturk_agent_1,But if we each get two firewood that means there are four available. Am I missing something? I didn't have any coffee this morning.,295,4
mturk_agent_2,I'm sorry you are correct. We would get 1 of each.,295,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ok no problem! I was wonderinf if I was going crazy haha. Ok so it sounds like we'll have to duke it out over the firewood. I'm going to a high altitude where there's not a lot of brush to collect, so that's why I want it. How about you?",295,5
mturk_agent_2,You can have the remaining firewood and food if you give me the remaining water.,295,5
mturk_agent_1,That works for me! Thanks!,295,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,295,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,295,7

mturk_agent_2,I think maybe your biggest need will be water.,297,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I agree that water would be the number one priority and it would help to be able to offer everyone a refreshing drink before letting them know how long the hike is.",297,4
mturk_agent_2,"So, I sugget you take the 3 pack of water and I will take the 3 pack of food and the 3 pack of firewood.",297,4

mturk_agent_2,"Of course! The only thing I really need is water, I'm camping deep in the woods and there's no lake or water source around me, so I need to keep as much water as possible.",302,1

mturk_agent_2,why do you need the water?,303,2
mturk_agent_1,I have a large family and we drink a case a day. Why do you need all the water?,303,3

mturk_agent_1,Sounds like a plan I will submit the deal.,303,5
mturk_agent_2,awesome,303,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,303,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,303,6
mturk_agent_1,"hi,are you a first time camper here",304,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello.  No I'm not a first time camper.  I'm a Girl Scout Troop Leader.  I'm excited to take my troop.  It's their first time. ,304,0
mturk_agent_1,"That means you probably came prepared. My son packed for us and i think he believes it's winter as we have lots of wood but not enough water. You wouldn't have any water you could spare, would you",304,1
mturk_agent_2,We could trade for some of your wood.  The girls are working on their fire starting badge and their cooking over an open fire badge.  🙂  ,304,1
mturk_agent_1,"Thanks, we didn't really want to carry this around all day",304,2
mturk_agent_2,"Great.  We can set up camp, and the girls can practice.  The co-leader is worried about insurance liability of the girls using an ax.  LOL!",304,2
mturk_agent_1,Let's hurry because I want to get as far away as possible from girls with an ax😡,304,3
mturk_agent_2,"We can trade your extra wood for our extra water, but we will need food to cook.",304,3
mturk_agent_1,"my boys will need to eat also as they will need their energy to fend off the ax wielding girls, i think an even swap of wood for water is very fair 🙂",304,4
mturk_agent_2,I have 12 Girl Scouts so I will need at least 2 of the food packages.  🙂,304,4
mturk_agent_1,"You have my boys greatly outnumbered and you have axes, i think i saw this once in a horror movie, i can do 3 woods for 3 waters, and i'll even throw in one food as long as it's a donation and tax deductible🙂",304,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,304,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,304,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there! I am really looking forward to camping! I am in need of water, if you have some to spare.",305,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, we tried to be as prepared as we could.  We packed plenty of water, and thought we would drink the ice water after it melts, so we can spare some for sure.",305,0
mturk_agent_1,"That was smart of you! If you have some food to apre too, that would be great!",305,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ah, not sure how we are on snacks; I would have to check.  We usually stay up way late eating and talking.  Maybe we could make a trade for some extra firewood to keep the fire going all night?",305,1
mturk_agent_1,"I love snacking too! I get cold very easily, so I don't need any firewood. You can have all of the firewood.",305,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh!  In that case, I'm sure I can dig out some extra food--you don't mind that it's mostly junkfood, right? 🙂",305,2
mturk_agent_1,I only want junk food! 🙂,305,3
mturk_agent_2,Excellent.  I'll get out the water bottles and search through the food--make sure I don't give away too many of my wife's favorites.  Ha.,305,3
mturk_agent_1,Fantastic! It has been a pleasure chatting with you today! ,305,4
mturk_agent_2,For sure--hope you enjoy your trip.  Stop by our fire if you want to hang out! 🙂,305,4
mturk_agent_1,Great! So I will take all of your water and then give you all of my firewood. How shall we split the food?,305,5
mturk_agent_2,"Well, simply let me know how much you think you'll need.  I have to keep some (like I said, wifey-poo) of course.  Just trying to have a good trip.",305,5
mturk_agent_1,I would appreciate 1 of the snacks! Thanks!,305,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,305,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,305,7
mturk_agent_2,i can give you one firewood if you let me have all the food and water. is that ok with you?,306,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! No, I don't think that's going to work for me. I can give you two food and two waters if you give me all three firewood. Tell me - do you like s'mores? 🙂",306,0
mturk_agent_2,"i do, you can have all the firewood, please let me have all the water and food then",306,1
mturk_agent_1,We're having a s'mores party at our campground with the firewood! You'd be welcome to come. Would you be willing to spare one extra water?,306,1
mturk_agent_2,"that is fine, one water and 3 firewood ",306,2
mturk_agent_1,"Three firewood and one water for all the food and two waters? Is that correct? 😮 Tell me, what are you going to do with the food?",306,2
mturk_agent_2,"yes it is, i have guests and i did not have any food in the house, though i still need more water",306,3
mturk_agent_1,"Since I'm feeling generous, would you like to have one more water package? 🙂 I can get by with just one. ",306,3
mturk_agent_2,"that's really helpful, thanks a lot, all the food and water, right?",306,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes! 🙂 Of course. All the food and water for all the firewood, correct?",306,4
mturk_agent_2,"yeah, you are awesome .🙂",306,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,306,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,306,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello. I really need the extra water so that I can remain safe while camping. I get dehydrated. ,307,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm traveling with kids and it's going to be really hot during day time. Want to make sure that everyone is safe. How about you let me keep two waters and all of the extra food. You can have all of the firewood.,307,0
mturk_agent_1,"I understand that you have kids, but I require extra water to avoid dehydrating and cramping. How about I keep 2 waters, 2 firewoods and one food. ",307,1
mturk_agent_2,How many people are you traveling with? Do you really need this much water? Let me keep two waters.,307,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes. I need a lot of water to stay hydrated. I am traveling with two other people. ,307,2
mturk_agent_2,If you are keeping two waters can I get two of firewood and two of food?,307,2
mturk_agent_1,You can definitely have two food. Will you be cooking a lot? I cook a lot which is why I wanted two of the firewood. 🙂,307,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, as I said I'm traveling with family so we will be doing a lot of cooking and sitting at the fire pit in the evening. That's why I need two firewood",307,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok. I understand. I will let you have 2 firewood and 2 food. I will take the two waters, 1 firewood and 1 food. ",307,4
mturk_agent_2,Sounds great!,307,4
mturk_agent_1,You have a deal. Thanks. ,307,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,307,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,307,6
mturk_agent_1,hello.i am going on a trip with my family can i have 2 firewood while you get 1 and 2 food.let me know your thought,308,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, Hope you are doing good. My preference over the other was low when compared to wood.",308,0
mturk_agent_1,okay so can i take 2 firewood 1 food 2 water .while you take 1 firewood 2 food and 1 water,308,1
mturk_agent_2,"but for my friends, they need firewood, the most. I said when comparing wood, other preference was low. it means, i too wood at the most. ☹️",308,1
mturk_agent_1,okay you can take 2 wood 1 food.can i take 1 wood 2food and 3 water.let me knoe if it is okay,308,2
mturk_agent_2,"think of my proposal to u. ""for you ,1 wood, 2 food, 2 water"". ""for me, 2 wood, 1 water, 1 food"". If the proposal is not acceptable, let me know of some other possibilities.",308,2
mturk_agent_1,i like your proposal but can i suggest 3 water for me ?,308,3
mturk_agent_2,"i need minimum amount water to drink☹️, That is why am asking ? Think of my situation and  give 1 water alone.",308,3
mturk_agent_1,okay then i will accept your proposal.i will atek 1 wood 2 food and 2 water .i guess my family will appreciate this ,308,4
mturk_agent_2,that's so nice of you to understand my situation. Don't submit the deal until we clearly discuss about the packages one more time. Is that okay for you ?,308,4
mturk_agent_1,okay so i am glad we could negotiate easily ,308,5
mturk_agent_2,"yeah, to get clear about the deal, we can discuss about the same thing twice, that isn't a problem.🙂. Your family can manage with the amount of water and food ?",308,5
mturk_agent_1,yes i am okay with the deal.i take 1 wood 2 food 2water  and you take 1water 2 wood 1 food,308,6
mturk_agent_2,"that's so nice of you. Am very happy for accepting this deal. For me 2 wood, 1 water and 1 food. For you, 1 wood , water and 2 food. Is that correct ? after confirming this, we can submit the deal. ",308,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,308,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,308,7
mturk_agent_2,"What are your priorities with the packages? Because I would be camping with my family I would really need the extra water, and probably also some firewood.",309,0
mturk_agent_1,well that is the same as me as I have small children and need extra of all three items,309,0
mturk_agent_2,Is there an item you would like over the others?,309,1
mturk_agent_1,well maybe the water as we will need to cook with it as well,309,1
mturk_agent_2,"I also would need water, but I also really enjoy campfires too, which I would want extra wood for.",309,2
mturk_agent_1,Not willing to give up much wood! How are you feeling about the food?,309,2
mturk_agent_2,"I don't think I would need too much extra food. More concerned about running out of water, or having extra wood. Do you have a suggested split for the packages?",309,3
mturk_agent_1,how about I get 4 firewoods and 4 waters and you get 4 food items?,309,3
mturk_agent_2,No I am not okay with that deal. We will need to split it up more evenly,309,4
mturk_agent_1,What is your best offer for me to think about?,309,4
mturk_agent_2,"So we only get 3 items of each not 4. So my offer would be that you get 2 waters, I get 1. I'll take 3 firewood, and you can have 2 food, and I have 1",309,5
mturk_agent_1,That sounds fair so lets enter it to submit! Thanks for working with me!,309,5
mturk_agent_2,your welcome,309,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,309,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,309,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how is your camping trip going?",31,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there.  Hoping it'll be good, and yours as well.  I was hoping we could negotiate so I could get this extra water - I was planning on this being a hiking trip and it's pretty warm and humid out, so I imagine I'll need it.",31,0
mturk_agent_2,I don't have any problems letting you have all 3 waters. Would you be willing to give me all 3 firewood? I need extra to keep me warm as I get cold easily.,31,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's a little tough for me but if we can come to an agreement where I get 2 of the food, I'd be willing to play ball.  We both deserve a good camping trip, after all.",31,1
mturk_agent_2,That's true. We both deserve a good trip. Why do you need more food?,31,2
mturk_agent_1,"Because I planned to go hiking and it wouldn't leave me time to chop much of any myself.  Even if I did, I'd have to carry it back and that's obviously not very smart in this heat.  But if I had the extra food, I'd be willing to inconvenience myself with getting firewood and cutting my hike a little short because I know the firewood is important to you.",31,2
mturk_agent_2,"You're right. I do not plan on hiking so you need more food than me. If I am correct, would I get 3 firewood/1 food while you get 3 water/2 food?",31,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's what I could live with, yes.",31,3
mturk_agent_2,We should be able to trade soon. I hope you have a great trip!,31,4
mturk_agent_1,You too!  Great birdwatching this season.,31,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,31,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,31,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi!  I am pregnant and eating more than my usual and want to secure enough food for camping.  I would like to take 3 foods and 2 waters to hydrate after eating; then you can take all of the firewood?,310,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I have a huge group coming that will also be very hungry hungry and thirsty. maybe we could split a little more evenly",310,0
mturk_agent_2,What would you propose?  Perhaps even a chance your group can bring some extra supplies too!,310,1
mturk_agent_1,"Maybe you could have 2 food, 1 water, and 2 firewood",310,1
mturk_agent_2,"I really want to secure I'm hydrating appropriately - I tell you, pregnancy swelling is the real deal!  How about I take 2 food and 2 water and 1 firewood?",310,2
mturk_agent_1,"My group could get by although it would be tough since there's so many people, on 1 food, 1 water, and 3 firewood",310,2
mturk_agent_2,What do you think will be most important and essential to sustain your group?,310,3
mturk_agent_1,food and water,310,3
mturk_agent_2,Tough - those are what I find is most essential for my health right now too.  Do you have a stronger need for food or water for the group?  ☹️,310,4
mturk_agent_1,"i'd like food more than water, though I'm willing to give you the majority of both. Just 1 food and 1 water for me if I have 3 firewood",310,4
mturk_agent_2,"You know what, I would be okay with that.  Giving 1 food and 1 water along with all of the firewood.  I will then keep 2 food and 2 waters.  ",310,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,310,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,310,6
mturk_agent_2,Hi there I am having a special sweet 16 birthday party for my daughter 🙂,311,0
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, that sounds like fun. What do you plan on doing?",311,0
mturk_agent_2,We want to have a picnic lunch for everyone and then a bonfire to roast marshmallows,311,1
mturk_agent_1,I am planning on going camping too! ,311,1
mturk_agent_2,Are you going alone or with someone?,311,2
mturk_agent_1,"I am going with my 2 kids for the weekend, they have never been cmaping before",311,2
mturk_agent_2,That's great! Are you doing a camp fire for them?,311,3
mturk_agent_1,"I do plan on making a camp fire, but I am pretty good at making them without too much wood. I would like to have some extra water though just to make sure we have enough",311,3
mturk_agent_2,I do need a lot of water because of a health condition but I am pretty sure we brought enough.,311,4
mturk_agent_1,"Oh ok, but you would like some extra fire wood?",311,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,311,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,311,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I am looking forward to the camping trip but I could really use extra food and water.  How about I take the food and water and you can have the extra firewood?,312,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'd love to take the extra firewood, but i'd like some of the food or water as well.",312,0
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, maybe we can compromise.  If you are willing to share the firewood, we could share some of the food and water.  Which do you think you will need the most of?",312,1
mturk_agent_1,I would need the most wood. and then food. what are your most important needs?,312,1
mturk_agent_2,I could definitely use the extra food because I am very active and will burn calories pretty quickly on this trip.  I also would like extra water. ,312,2
mturk_agent_1,Which is more important to you - the food or water?,312,2
mturk_agent_2,Food is the most important to me.,312,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok. And between the water and firewood, which is most important?",312,3
mturk_agent_2,"Water is more important to me than firewood 🙂 I would love a little extra firewood for s'mores, but I need the water more.  Do you need extra water?",312,4
mturk_agent_1,"What if I take all of the firewood, give you all the water, and i take two food?",312,4
mturk_agent_2,"Food is my highest priority, so what if I take 2 food, 2 water, and you can have the rest?",312,5
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good. We can go with that!,312,5
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, great!",312,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,312,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,312,7
mturk_agent_1,Hello there! Excited for your camping trip?🙂,313,0
mturk_agent_2,"Very excited! I am very, very fat! And my partner is very, very skinny! I need all your food.",313,0
mturk_agent_1,"Ha! Well then we might be in a bit of a pickle! I'm going to an area overrun by ants, and most of whatever I bring will be carted off by those little pests in my sleep. Food is vital for me.",313,1
mturk_agent_2,I will eat you if you don't give me at least 2 foods. 😡\,313,1
mturk_agent_1,"Hard to argue with that! I'm sure we can work something out. Water is also important to me. Firewood is too, but less so. How important is Water to you?",313,2
mturk_agent_2,Water is important or else I will eat my skinny friend. And you too.  I need 2 waters.😡,313,2
mturk_agent_1,"2 Waters AND 2 Foods? You, my friend, are quite bold! I assume Firewood is not super duper important to you?",313,3
mturk_agent_2,"It will be unacceptable to part with more than one firewood, or else I will eat you, my partner, and your entire camping party. I am a bear. 😡",313,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ugh you bears. 😡 Always trying to take from us hard working humans! Participate in society like the rest of us you wild animal! What if we were to do this: I take all the Food and 1 Water, and you get everything else.",313,4
mturk_agent_2,UNACCEPTABLE! 😡,313,4
mturk_agent_1,"😮 you drive a hard bargain! How about I get all the Food, 1 Firewood, and you get everything else?",313,5
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,313,5
mturk_agent_1,"It's so good to be talking to you before this historic camping trip we're all going to be going on. You're gonna love it. But before we go, we need to figure out the best deal for everybody, and that's what I want. I want all of us to win. Tell me, what do you need most in the world? I'm gonna get that for you.",314,0
mturk_agent_2,"That would be awesome! I really need some more water. I need it so that I can take my medications with it. It's very important to me. To get this, I'm willing to give you as much firewood as you need. How does that sound to you?",314,0
mturk_agent_1,"That's tough, real tough. Everybody wants you to be able to take your medicine, and it wold be terrific if you could, but everyone has to make sacrifices for the greater good. I need ALL of the water. Non negotiable. That sounds tough, I know, but I'm ready to give you the deal of a life time for it. A deal you've never seen before and won't see again. I'll take all the water, it's true, but in return I'm offering you two wood and ALL THE FOOD. A dynamite deal.",314,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh wow. That is tough. That is a good deal. May I ask - why do you need the water? ,314,1
mturk_agent_1,"The world is a scary place out there, it's getting tougher for us regular people to get by, especially with companies dumping chemicals in our water supplies, poisoning us. I'm pledging to my camping group, we're gonna have the cleanest water around. So clean they won't believe it. Frankly even I don't believe it and I'm seeing it with my own eyes. They're gonna love it.",314,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think that's a very noble cause. Maybe other people in our camping group can supply some water? I'd be more than happy to give you two waters, and I will take just 1 water for myself, even though I need it very badly for my health. ",314,2
mturk_agent_1,"You're making this tough for me. Real tough. I'm not a bad guy though. I'm willing to help the people even if I don't agree wit them. It's going to cost you though. If you get one water, I'm going to need two wood. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Everybody gets the best deal. You're making out like a bandit with all the food. That'll be terrific for you.",314,3
mturk_agent_2,"How important is the wood to you? Ideally, how many would you need?",314,3
mturk_agent_1,"If you're getting one water, I have to have two wood. I'm already breaking my pledge not to negotiate on the water. That's huge. I have to come out of this looking strong for my people. They're not going to like seeing me break on such a big pledge I made. You get one water, one wood and three food. That'll be big for you, getting the entire stack like that. Huge!",314,4
mturk_agent_2,I think this is a fair proposal... I'll be willing to give up two of my wood (even though it is very high priority) since you are generous enough to give me a water. ,314,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,314,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,314,5
mturk_agent_1,I was wondering if maybe i could get 2 food packages 1 firewood and 3 waters? pretty please?,315,0
mturk_agent_2,I really need 2 food packages because we have a lot of people to feed. I could give you 2 water if you give me the 2 foo packages. How does that sound?,315,0
mturk_agent_1,😮oh no! i left my cooler of food at home so we dont have any food at all. i dont have any use for water unfortunately ,315,1
mturk_agent_2,oh wow okay okay i can give you 2 food packages and i can get 1. ,315,1
mturk_agent_1,🙂 thank you so much! that is very helpful to me. thanks for being compassionate. so what sounds fair with regards to firewood and water?,315,2
mturk_agent_2,okay could i have 2 waters since we will be using more than i thought with the amount of people. So i get 2 and you get one does that sound good for the water?,315,2
mturk_agent_1,i am willing to give you all three waters if you would like 3 instead of 2 because there is a stream next to our campsite and i could get water there. would you take all 3 instead of 2 waters?,315,3
mturk_agent_2,okay that would be great thank you so much. and the wood what do you think?,315,3
mturk_agent_1,i would like to have at last 2 of the firewood as i have a broken ankle and am unable to gather firewood myself. i am camping with small children and i dont expect for them to be much help with gathering wood,315,4
mturk_agent_2,"okay, i can do that i will give you 2 ",315,4
mturk_agent_1,actually can we revisit the water. could i get 1 water and you can have 2,315,5
mturk_agent_2,"okay that fine i can do that with that water, Thats no problem",315,5
mturk_agent_1,thank you!🙂 so i get 2 food 2 firewood and 1 water? thats awesome thank you? we have a deal?,315,6
mturk_agent_2,yes that correct! it s a deal,315,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,315,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,315,7
mturk_agent_2,Hi there.  I'm looking forward to this camping trip but I tend to get a little cold at night.  I'm hoping we can make a deal for some of the extra firewood.,316,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, it sounds like we can work something out. I find it hard to hunt or fish, so I am looking for some extra food",316,0
mturk_agent_2,Sounds like something we can split equitably then.  My metabolism is kind of slow so I don't usually need to eat that much. 🙂,316,1
mturk_agent_1,Well that's good!,316,1
mturk_agent_2,"I agree.  So could I trade you the extra food for the firewood?  And we'll have to figure out what to do with this spare water, I suppose.",316,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I am more than happy to give you 3 firefood for 3 food?",316,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm perfectly happy with that.  Do you have suggestions on how to split the water between us?,316,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well one of us can get 2 and the other can get 1, since there are 3 we can't evenly split it",316,3
mturk_agent_2,"Right.  Would you be okay if we just flip a coin, if it's just of equal importance to the both of us?",316,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes that would be fine, you can flip it and I will trust you. I choose tails",316,4
mturk_agent_2,"Looks like 2 to you then.  So I'll receive 3 firewood, 1 water, and 0 food.  You'll receive 3 water, 2 food, 0 firewood?",316,5
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I get 3 food, 2 water, 0 firewood. And you get 0 food, 1 water, 3 firewood. It's a deal",316,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,316,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,316,6
mturk_agent_1,I'll give you three food for three water and three firewood. ,317,0
mturk_agent_2,"I don't need any more food, my family has alot of food intolerances. But I am willing to trade 3 food for 3 firewood.",317,0
mturk_agent_1,☹️ I mainly need water. I drink way more than most people. Any other suggestions?,317,1
mturk_agent_2,I hear you on that. I need alot of firewood 😮How about 3 waters for 3 firewood? I'm guessing neither of us need food ,317,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, food is a low priority for me. How about I give you three firewood for three water and three food?",317,2
mturk_agent_2,That doesn't sound like a fair trade to me.,317,2
mturk_agent_1,Perhaps we can reach an agreement with further negotiating.,317,3
mturk_agent_2,"I need some water for my dog, he's big and overheats easily. I'll trade you 2 waters and 2 food for 3 firewood 1 water",317,3
mturk_agent_1,I don't like the sound of that. Sorry. ,317,4
mturk_agent_2,☹️ how could we make that better,317,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,317,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,317,5
mturk_agent_2,"You're moving kinda shady and I really don't like that, I'm running out of time for this HIT anyway, my final offer is gonna be 3 firewood + 1 food for 3 waters",317,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,317,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,317,7

mturk_agent_1,Wow that is the best have hard so far thanks.,318,2

mturk_agent_1,okay give me 3 food 2 firewood and the rest is all yours,318,4
mturk_agent_2,we agree on exchanging the firewood for the water. I am also interested in the food though. Is there something we could work out that will allow me to have at least one food?,318,4
mturk_agent_1,okay waht about 2 foods 3 firewoods?,318,5
mturk_agent_2,"okay so you receive 2 foods, 3 fire. I receive 3 water and 1 food? ",318,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,318,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,318,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello there!  How are you doing?,319,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello. I am doing great. Excited for my camping trip. How are you?,319,0
mturk_agent_1,Oh I hear you!  I'm super excited too!  Just kind of getting some last minute packing done! ,319,1
mturk_agent_2,I hope it will be a good time.,319,1
mturk_agent_1,Me too!  Well I'll just start by saying I am placing firewood very high on my priority list.  We will be doing a lot of fishing so I feel like I may need some extra firewood for all the cooking I will be doing.,319,2
mturk_agent_2,Great. I'm bringing water and I may need more in order to keep myself hydrated at all times. I'm a big guy.,319,2
mturk_agent_1,Ok that is a good idea!  Hydration is important!  I think we will have plenty to drink so I have water at the bottom of my priority.,319,3
mturk_agent_2,How about we strike a deal? I could use some more water packages.,319,3
mturk_agent_1,Ok what are you thinking?,319,4
mturk_agent_2,Food is pretty low on my priority list. I'm willing to give up some of that.,319,4
mturk_agent_1,Ok so how about you take all 3 water packages and I take all 3 firewood and I'll give you 2 food to my 1.  Or would you rather each take some of everything?,319,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,319,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,319,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello!🙂,32,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you?",32,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm fine, let's talk about how we can come to a fair deal.",32,1
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, my number one item if food if you can spare any.",32,1
mturk_agent_1,It'd be nice if we can both get an even split right?,32,2
mturk_agent_2,Well some needs are higher than others.  I need more food but I can give up some firewood or water.,32,2
mturk_agent_1,I think we can start off with 3 water for me and 3 food for you,32,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good. What about firewood?,32,3
mturk_agent_1,Can I get 2 firewood?,32,4
mturk_agent_2,Sure,32,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,32,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,32,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello I am a diabetic so I was wondering if I could get the majority of the food?,320,0
mturk_agent_2,I understand your need. How about i get all the firewood and 1 package of food and 1 package of water as i am stuck in a dense part of the forest without the ability to hunt.,320,0
mturk_agent_1,That is an aggressive offer. Why do you need firewood and water if you can't hunt? Wouldn't you need food?,320,1
mturk_agent_2,The area i am in is damp and i do not have the ability to start a fire and stay warm. ,320,1
mturk_agent_1,If you get all the firewood I must get all the food then. ,320,2
mturk_agent_2,If i agree to that then i want 2 packages of water as well. ,320,2
mturk_agent_1,No I want the two packages. ,320,3
mturk_agent_2,I am sorry but i have to have water if you have all the food.,320,3
mturk_agent_1,Guess we're not making a deal,320,4
mturk_agent_2,That's too bad,320,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,320,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,320,5
mturk_agent_2,Please recall i am in the damp area of the forest and need to have firrewood to start a fire and survive. The min i need is 2 packages of water. Please help me,320,6
mturk_agent_1,I don't care. ,320,6
mturk_agent_2,I am disabled and trying to find water in the forest will be very difficult. ,320,7
mturk_agent_1,Right....... I'm diabetic I need all the resources. ,320,7
mturk_agent_2,"I understand and i am giving you all the food, but i do need at least 2 packages of water.",320,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,320,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,320,9
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I am camping soon and need some extra supplies. I believe that we can make an arrangement that will be mutually beneficial.,321,0
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good. I'm headed on a mountain adventure. How about you?,321,0
mturk_agent_1,"The jungle! To save my dear father, an archeologist, humanitarian, and double-kidney donor, from pirate marauders.",321,1
mturk_agent_2,What extra supplies will you need for something like that? ,321,1
mturk_agent_1,"The water is unclean where we are going, and our throats will be parched, so I need water first. Then food. It's hot in the jungle, so firewood is not of the most urgent need, but still helpful for cooking any varmints we find.",321,2
mturk_agent_2,I should be able to help with the water. I'm interested in food most of all.,321,2
mturk_agent_1,Great! What is your last priority?,321,3
mturk_agent_2,Water is the least of my concerns. I'll have plenty of mountain streams to use.,321,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay. Tell me what you think of this. I will get 3 water, 0 food, and 2 firewood. This will give you 3 of your most important item and 1 of your second most important. It will give me one more overall, but I ask for two firewood since that is my lowest-value need.",321,4
mturk_agent_2,I can do that.,321,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,321,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,321,5
mturk_agent_2,Good afternoon! I am really excited about going camping. What about you?,322,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I am also super excited to be camping! I am worried I may not have brought enough supplies but luckily we have more to choose from🙂,322,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes! Where are you going? What do you think you're going to need the most of?,322,1
mturk_agent_1,I honestly think I will need more Firewood. I am always freezing!! How about you? What do you think you will need the most of?,322,1
mturk_agent_2,"I too was thinking I was going to need firewood. I'm going where it's going to be very cold at night, so it would be best if I had firewood to keep myself from freezing at night. I need food second, then water last. How would you like to decide?",322,2
mturk_agent_1,Oh man! Those are all the things I need as well. I'm trying to figure out the best way to split up what we have here.,322,2
mturk_agent_2,"If you would like to take more firewood, I would like to take more food and vice versa. I will let you decide how you'd like to split that up. More firewood = less food and water?",322,3
mturk_agent_1,"I agree. That sounds fair to me! I could take 2 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water. That would still give you 1 Firewood, 2 food, and 1 water. What do you think?",322,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think it would be a little bit more fair if the person getting 2 firewood gets 1 food and 1 water. The other person gets 1 wood, 2 food, 2 water.",322,4
mturk_agent_1,"You are right, that does seem more fair. I agree with that",322,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,322,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,322,5
mturk_agent_2,Hey there!  Excited for the camping trip?,323,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes I am. How about you?,323,0
mturk_agent_2,Very much so!  Would you mind sharing your top priority items with me so that we can find a fair way to distribute them?,323,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, My highest priority item is food, because one time we almost ran out and had to cut the trip short and I would hate for that to happen again. Do you have anything you need most?",323,1
mturk_agent_2,"I need firewood the most since it will be so cold tonight, and we didn't bring any.  Would you be okay with me taking 3 packages of firewood and you taking 3 packages of food so that we each get our top needs satisfied?",323,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds good so far, however, how would we distribute the water?",323,2
mturk_agent_2,Well I guess unfortunately that one we can't distribute entirely easily.  Is water your medium or low priority item?,323,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I need water, but it's not a top priority",323,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, would you be okay with me taking 2 of the water then since it is actually my medium priority item?  I need it since I brought a large group of people camping with me and we forgot iodine pills to purify the river water",323,4
mturk_agent_1,"I would give you two waters, but I would want one firewood for that because you would be getting more of what you need than I am",323,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,323,5
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,323,5
mturk_agent_1,"I want either one more water or one firewood,",323,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,323,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,323,7
mturk_agent_2,Hi there fellow camper. How are ya?,324,0
mturk_agent_1,"Not bad, I'm new to camping so I'm hoping I can get your help and we can work together so we each have a great camping trip.",324,0
mturk_agent_2,"Sure 🙂 I forgot my jacket, so I am looking for some more firewood for the cool night",324,1
mturk_agent_1,"Firewood is important. I don't have a water filtration kit, so I'm hoping for some water.",324,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh man that sucks☹️I csn give you my 3 waters if you can spare me the 3 firewood,324,2
mturk_agent_1,"That's not bad, seems like a decent compromise, but we still have to discuss food.",324,2
mturk_agent_2,I'd like some extra food for energy. Would you be okay with just one food? Or do you need two?,324,3
mturk_agent_1,"Like I said, I'm new to camping, and having as much prepared food as I can have would make it easier.",324,3
mturk_agent_2,"ok, I'll make do with one then and give you two. So we are all set, right, 3 firewood and 1 food for me, 2 food and 3 water for you",324,4
mturk_agent_1,"That actually does seem fair, I'd really appreciate that.",324,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,324,5

mturk_agent_1,I need the least of food.   ,325,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I understand. If you got to choose, how much of everything would you want, and what would you give me?",325,2
mturk_agent_1,I will give you 3 food for 3 firewood. ,325,3
mturk_agent_2,I need some firewood ☹️,325,3
mturk_agent_1,How about 3 food for 2 firewood?,325,4
mturk_agent_2,Ok. Can I have all 3 water?,325,4
mturk_agent_1,3 water for what?  ,325,5
mturk_agent_2,"How do you want to divide the water? Do you need any, or can I have all 3?",325,5
mturk_agent_1,What will you give me for 3 water?,325,6
mturk_agent_2,"I'm already giving you most of the firewood, which we both need, but you said you wanted it the most. ",325,6
mturk_agent_1,2 firewood for 3 water?,325,7
mturk_agent_2,"You'll give me 2 firewood, 3 food, and no water? I'm fine with that",325,7
mturk_agent_1,Im trying to understand the deal you want.  You would like to give me 2 firewood for 3 water?,325,8
mturk_agent_2,"How about you take 2 firewood, I get 1. I take 2 food, you get one. And I'll take 2 waters, you take 1?",325,8

mturk_agent_1,I need food the most,326,2

mturk_agent_2,I am as well,327,1
mturk_agent_1,My favorite thing to do is to sing around a camp fire.  For that I will need firewood.  What do you like to do? ,327,1
mturk_agent_2,I like that as well but I also need firewood to cook the food I brought. Could I take two bundles of firewood? ,327,2
mturk_agent_1,I need more than one piece of firewood.  I can give you all the food if you give me all the water.  ,327,2

mturk_agent_2,Okay I'll take food need much more and you?,328,1
mturk_agent_1,"I will take the water and the wood. I do think the wood is important too. Keep us warm, we can cook and boil water. SInce we are taking more food more firewood is a must too🙂",328,2
mturk_agent_2,Yeah Thank you very much both we take wood to share.,328,2

mturk_agent_1,"I hear that. Well, I have plenty of food with me, and would be willing to offer all 3 food packages in exchange for the 3 firewoods. How does that sound to you?",329,1
mturk_agent_2,That sounds great!  We have lot beer but need some water.  Can we compromise there too?,329,1
mturk_agent_1,"I think that we can agree on water as well. You sound like a person after my own heart, so how about the 3 food packs as well as 2 of the 3 waters? 🙂",329,2
mturk_agent_2,Ya that works for me.  ,329,2

mturk_agent_1,what do you think you may need more?,330,1
mturk_agent_2,Well I am going to an area with less trees than normal. Usually I camp in the forest where you have firewood all around you. But this trip it might be hard to find.,330,2
mturk_agent_1,"what a coincidence, I will need more wood and lots of food. its very cold during the night",330,2
mturk_agent_2,I don't think food will be an issue for me. Water would be harder to find but I think it should be a fun trip.,330,3
mturk_agent_1,"Water is no big deal for me, so you can have that, and can have the food and some wood?",330,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah I think we can work something out, how about I take 3 waters and just 1 food and firewood? Does that sound ok?",330,4

mturk_agent_2,"Oh that is perfect! How about 3 firewood, 2 waters, and 0 food for you then?",331,1
mturk_agent_1,"How about 3 firewoods, 2 waters, and 1 food, just in case I can't find any food on my own.",331,2
mturk_agent_2,I can't really do that since I truly need a lot of food ☹️,331,2
mturk_agent_1,"You're right. I realize that we have 3 each.. so it sounds fair. So you will have 3 foods, 1 water, and 0 firewood?",331,3
mturk_agent_2,yes! that sounds perfect to me!,331,3

mturk_agent_2,I completely understand you have a medical condition. How much water would you require? I have a family of 5 and water runs out quick for us with young kids.,332,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh no this will be difficult,☹️ We have a large family as well with a breast feeding wife so food is important to us as well",332,2
mturk_agent_2,"This really is difficult my friend, I have a new born breast feeding as well! Unreal. How about you take the 2 packages of water since you have a med condition? And I get 3 firewood?",332,2
mturk_agent_1,Im not sure about the firewood what about the food?,332,3
mturk_agent_2,My family likes to have fires and cook on the fire pit around the clock. The food is not as big of a deal. Remember I am giving you 2 cases of water.🙂,332,3

mturk_agent_2,Yes i get 2 foods and you get 1. I get 1 wood an you get 2 and i get 2 waters an you get 1. do we have a deal?,333,4
mturk_agent_1,yeah that works for me my friend,333,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,333,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,333,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi,334,0
mturk_agent_1,hello how are you? ,334,0
mturk_agent_2,I am good thank you,334,1
mturk_agent_1,"I was hoping we could agree on the importance of food while camping. I would like all 3 packages, if thats okay with you?",334,1
mturk_agent_2,Well it is not okay I feel food is less important,334,2
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking that, while camping there are so many uncertainties, from wild life, loss of food, spoiling, what if we are stuck at the camp for whatever reason, having the food available brings a peace of mind, what do you think?",334,2
mturk_agent_2,Well I still think 1 or two packages will do. Probably 3 packages each for water and firewood sounds like a better idea what do you think?,334,3
mturk_agent_1,do you think we can comprise with 2 food and 2 waters? maybe middle ground would make both of us a bit more comfortable making a deal?,334,3
mturk_agent_2,Okay it sounds like a good idea,334,4
mturk_agent_1,"thank you so much, for firewood what would make you the happiest?",334,4
mturk_agent_2,I thought we agreed on 2 packages extra for each item?,334,5
mturk_agent_1,"awesome! 2 for all 3 categories, submitting now, thank you so much. have a wonderful day ",334,5
mturk_agent_2,You too,334,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,334,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,334,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, How are you!",335,0
mturk_agent_1,I am doing well.  You?,335,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm good. Do you have an initial proposal?,335,1
mturk_agent_1,I would like to have more firewood please.  I do not want to freeze to death out there camping.  If you can spare more that would be terrific.  Perhaps 2 more piles would be ok.  ,335,1
mturk_agent_2,I can spare 2 firewood if you can give up 2 waters. I am in a hot location and need to stay hydrated.,335,2
mturk_agent_1,of course.  Also food I do not want to run out and starve.  2 more of whatever extra food you may have would be great.  I may stay longer at site so extra food would help.,335,2
mturk_agent_2,"Let me think about this... So far I would get 2 waters, 1 firewood and 1 food. You would get 1 water, 2 firewood and 2 foods. Am I correct?",335,3
mturk_agent_1,"If you can spare sure, if not then one more extra food would help",335,3
mturk_agent_2,I would be willing to let you have all the food if you let me have all the water. I think you would need the food more if you are staying longer.,335,4
mturk_agent_1,ok sounds good!,335,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,335,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,335,5
mturk_agent_2,hello,336,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there, hope I would be able to exchange some needed items for my family of 7 from you.",336,0
mturk_agent_2,wow that is much,336,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's the typical reaction I get 🙂. That said, I would like to get the basics for our survival - food and water.",336,1
mturk_agent_2,likewise me to,336,2
mturk_agent_1,"of the two, which is your priority? Mine is water",336,2
mturk_agent_2,Also water,336,3
mturk_agent_1,"ok. How about 1 take 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood",336,3
mturk_agent_2,no that not fair for me,336,4
mturk_agent_1,what are your options?,336,4
mturk_agent_2,3 food 2 firewood and you can have 3 food and 1 firewood,336,5
mturk_agent_1,I would take 3 water and 1 firewood,336,5
mturk_agent_2,that was a mistake i mean i would take 3 water and 2 firewood,336,6
mturk_agent_1,that's not fair to me as well. I clearly stated water as our family's priority item.,336,6
mturk_agent_2,i also have that as my highest priority,336,7
mturk_agent_1,"In that case, I get 3 packs of food and 2 packs of firewood - final offer",336,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,336,8
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,336,8
mturk_agent_2,Hello. I hope you are doing well. So what items are you looking for?,337,0
mturk_agent_1,We are doing good. Hope you are well and healthy! I really need the food. I have 4 boys with me and they eat like an elephant!,337,0
mturk_agent_2,"I understand that. I am very similar to your boys. I am always hungry no matter how much I eat. It's a curse, really. I don't know about you, but I can tell when I'm hungry because I feel lightheaded and weak.",337,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes. Couldn't agree more! Which item do you prefer most?,337,1
mturk_agent_2,I really would prefer food as well. I want to have the energy and ability to really enjoy this camping trip. How do you feel about firewood and food as well?,337,2
mturk_agent_1,"I prefer water than firewood. I just don't like going to the river to get water. besides, I think our campsite is far from the river. How about you?",337,2
mturk_agent_2,"I don't mind filtering water even though it doesn't always taste great. I do like firewood so I can cook some actual meals instead of having to eat granola bars the whole time. I love the feeling of a nice fire, too.",337,3
mturk_agent_1,Firewood is nice and We can roast marshmallow. The boys will like it!,337,3
mturk_agent_2,"So how do you think we should split this? We both want food, but I think I really like firewood and you really like water.",337,4
mturk_agent_1,I am Ok with 1 food and 3 water. how about that? ,337,4
mturk_agent_2,So I would get 2 food and 3 firewood? I like that deal.,337,5
mturk_agent_1,"If it is possible, can you give me 1 firewood? Just so we can make smores.. The kids will be really grateful! 🙂",337,5
mturk_agent_2,"I can do that if I could have a water, just at least to get me through the night.",337,6
mturk_agent_1,"well, I really prefer water. And you already have more food...",337,6
mturk_agent_2,True but I gladly offered all of the water to you. You at least still get 1 food.,337,7
mturk_agent_1,Ok. maybe I'll come to your camp to roast the marshmallow then. You got a deal.,337,7
mturk_agent_2,You can come over any time you want! I'll even bring some camp chairs 🙂,337,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,337,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,337,9
mturk_agent_2,Hello!  I am gearing up to go camping this weekend?  Are you also planning to go camping?,338,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello .  . yes, we're going to Joshua Tree NP to do some rock climbing.  What are your preferences for extra supplies?🙂",338,0
mturk_agent_2,Nice!  I'm going to go in the Allegheny mountains in Pennsylvania?  My main priority is food because we will be doing a lot of hiking and will need to refuel our bodies.,338,1
mturk_agent_1,"I see.  I would most prefer the water--we are in a hot, desert climate without much natural water sources.I also need food, however, as we are in a large group with lots of college students--big appetites!  I would like to take the waters, one food package, and one firewood.",338,1
mturk_agent_2,Let's start with the food first.  Would you be interested in keeping all of the waters and I would keep all of the food packages?,338,2
mturk_agent_1,"That is possible, but the problem is that I don't think I would have enough food.  We would have to do some hunting probably to have enough food.  I would be willing to give up all the food but I would need to take two firewood  to help cook the game.  The nights in the desert can be cold, too, so I think the firewood would help.",338,2
mturk_agent_2,How about I keep 2 food packages and you keep 1 package?  Does that sound workable?,338,3
mturk_agent_1,It is workable if you throw in at least 1 firewood.🙂,338,3
mturk_agent_2,So you want me to take 2 firewood and you get 1 firewood ?,338,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I can give up two firewood and two food for 3 waters packs, 1 food, and 1 firewood.",338,4
mturk_agent_2,Would I be able to get a water pack and you keep two? I'm not sure if I can make it without atny water?,338,5
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, that won't work for me☹️ I am running out of time.  I ask you to reconsider this last offer.  If we don't come to an agreement we will both suffer.",338,5
mturk_agent_2,It's only fair if I get 1 too.  ,338,6
mturk_agent_1,"You might consider that fairness is not just about even distribution, but need.  You haven't expressed any reasons for why you should take the water, or the firewood, for that matter. There are plenty of water sources in the Pennsylvania mountains and rural areas.  My last offer stands, or I will have to walk away.",338,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,338,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,338,7
mturk_agent_2,Hello,339,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you today?",339,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am doing great, how about you?",339,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm doing well! ,339,1
mturk_agent_2,I am in desperate need of food and water for camping because I have a large group of people with me,339,2
mturk_agent_1,I too am in need of water because the place I'm going doesn't have access to any.,339,2
mturk_agent_2,I guess I will have to cancel my trip and are regulations then,339,3
mturk_agent_1,I would be happy to trade my food for your firewood though. We can start from there.,339,3
mturk_agent_2,I don't need extra firewood at all because I have a lot of blankets,339,4
mturk_agent_1,It is good to be prepared.,339,4
mturk_agent_2,You can have all the firewood if I can have all the food,339,5
mturk_agent_1,I can do that.,339,5
mturk_agent_2,"Since It is 120 degrees where I am going, I should take 2 water",339,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,339,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,339,7
mturk_agent_2,hi ,34,0
mturk_agent_1,hello,34,0
mturk_agent_2,i need a lot of packages from you,34,1
mturk_agent_1,I do too.,34,1
mturk_agent_2,Can you give me your offer?,34,2
mturk_agent_1,I would like 3 firewods 1 food and 1 water we stay up late and need extra firewood,34,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh thats expensive .There's too much cold out here and thats our major package for survival ,34,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay when we are not camping we work at night so we are use to being up at night so we like extra firewood just to sit around campfire and chat,34,3
mturk_agent_2,Yours is still better.You using it for cht but we seriously need it for survival.But i can give you a firewood and a pakage of water in exchange for two firewoods.What do you think?,34,4
mturk_agent_1,Well how about I get two firewood and you can have all the water.,34,4
mturk_agent_2,hummmm...let me have two food and and 3 water in exchange of 2 firewood,34,5
mturk_agent_1,Okay I will go for that and hope this satisfies you.,34,5
mturk_agent_2,yeah,34,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,34,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,34,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there, looking forward to the camping trip, going to have a fun time, how many people do you have joining you?",340,0
mturk_agent_1,I am going with just one friend. We are going hiking. How about you?,340,0
mturk_agent_2,"We have a group of four total, we plan to hike and also go kayaking. The weather looks like it may be a hot one!",340,1
mturk_agent_1,Yeah it won't get too cold at night for me. I won't need much firewood. I do need plenty of water. What do you need most?,340,1
mturk_agent_2,"Water is also what I will need, and food. Not so much firewood either.",340,2
mturk_agent_1,Could I have two waters if I give you 2 foods and 2 firewood?,340,2
mturk_agent_2,"yea, I could do that, so I would get 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood?  I can probably handle that, we do want to make some S'mores. I found some recipes for some good ones!",340,3
mturk_agent_1,awesome lets do this deal. have fun! 🙂,340,3
mturk_agent_2,You too! stay safe! ,340,4
mturk_agent_1,Great. I think we did a really good job here.,340,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,340,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,340,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi there! I figured it might be best to start off with asking which packages you wanted extra of?,341,0
mturk_agent_2,"I need three packages of water and three food.  I am going to a dry, hot location.  We will be hiking a lot. ",341,0
mturk_agent_1,"Ah, I see! You definitely will need extra water then 🙂 I also was hoping to get extra packages of food as well.",341,1
mturk_agent_2,Are there any sources of food for you there where you are staying?  We are out in the wilderness and there are no convenience stores for 50 plus miles. Plus we will be on the trail a lot. Very primitive camping.,341,1
mturk_agent_1,"I see, I think we're definitely in similar situations. I won't have much access to food either, and we have a lot of people going camping with us, so we wanted to make sure we prepared so everyone gets a fair share of food.",341,2
mturk_agent_2,"😮 Okay.  Well, I can see we have a dilemma.  Since the temperatures will be warm, I wasn't planning on doing too many fires, but how about this?  I can take the three waters, you take 2 of the extra food, and I'll take 2 firewood?",341,2
mturk_agent_1,"You can definitely have the three waters! 🙂 As for the firewood, I did plan on having a fire for a majority of the night, so I'd definitely like extra wood! I was actually going to ask if you would be willing to give me the 3 packages of firewood?",341,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, if I leave you 2 of the packages of food, then I  need more firewood to trade for food, or, to cook fish that I catch.  Which do you need more, the wood or the food?",341,3
mturk_agent_1,"For sure, I completely understand. I definitely would need the food more than the water!",341,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, thanks for the water.  I can give you all of the wood. It would really help me to take two food packages.🙂🙂",341,4
mturk_agent_1,"I misspoke in my last message, as I meant I would need the food more than the wood. But I'd be willing to give you the 3 water and 2 food! I'll take the 3 wood and 1 food?",341,5
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, sounds like a deal . . . are you ready to submit?",341,5
mturk_agent_1,Yes! You can go ahead and submit your deal 🙂,341,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,341,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,341,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, How are you today?",342,0
mturk_agent_2,Great! I'm so excited to go camping. How are you?🙂,342,0
mturk_agent_1,"Me too, feeling great. Nice weather!",342,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes it sure is. It'll be great to finally get out of the house. What supplies are you hoping to stock up on before the trip>,342,1
mturk_agent_1,True. I would love it if you stock me up with 3 packages of water and 2 packages of firewood and i will give up 2 food.,342,2
mturk_agent_2,Sounds like we have the same Christmas list haha. My family has a bunch of hikes planned so we need water too.,342,2
mturk_agent_1,Ooops! You mean we came out a whole lot of us!🙂,342,3
mturk_agent_2,"How's this... one of us gets 2 waters,1 firewood and 2 foods, the other 1 water, 2 firewoods and 1 food. Pick whichever you like.",342,3
mturk_agent_1,"I will go for the first, 2 waters, 1 firewoodand 2 foods. Looks like we have a deal🙂",342,4
mturk_agent_2,Great. Have a fun trip!,342,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,342,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,342,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi! Ready to start negotiating?,343,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello.  Ready to go 🙂 ,343,0
mturk_agent_1,My highest priority item is water. I am a type 1 Diabetic and therefore I get extremely thirsty and dehydrate quickly throughout the day. What is your highest priority?,343,1
mturk_agent_2,My highest priority is food.  I'm taking 12 girl scouts camping.  We are learning to cook while camping.  I really want them to have a great camping experience and learn to be independent. ,343,1
mturk_agent_1,That works well because my lowest priority is food. I propose that I only take one and you get the other two.,343,2
mturk_agent_2,I will give you all the water if I can get all the food.,343,2
mturk_agent_1,That's a deal. I am on a very strict diet and believe I will be able to find alternative food sources.,343,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I will need firewood to cook the food, so I can give you 1 of the food back if I can have all of the firewood.  I want them each to start a fire.  ",343,3
mturk_agent_1,I get cold very easily due to low iron and hypothyroidism. Staying warm is a necessity for me. I need one package of firewood and you take the rest? Your girl scouts can huddle for extra warmth.,343,4
mturk_agent_2,"We do love to sing and huddle.  🙂  So I would trade all my water for all your food, and you would get one firewood?  ",343,4
mturk_agent_1,I am good with that!,343,5
mturk_agent_2,Great!  Enjoy your trip.  🙂  Keep hydrated and warm to stabilize your blood sugar.  Thanks a bunch. ,343,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,343,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,343,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello! What is your highest priority item you are looking for?,344,0
mturk_agent_1,I definitely need water as there is no lake at my campsite. I'm going to need it to wash up and to hydrate.,344,0
mturk_agent_2,"I understand, we all need water to keep hydrated. What is your next priority item? 🙂",344,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm going to need firewood so that I can cook my meals. There aren't many trees around here weirdly enough.,344,1
mturk_agent_2,I see. I think we will be able to work out a fair deal. I need water too not ony for hydration but for my toddlers who will camping with us too. What do you propose?,344,2
mturk_agent_1,How much food do you need? I am well stocked with food and probably won't need any extra,344,2
mturk_agent_2,I would accept 3 food so you can have 3 firewood but I really need 2 waters.,344,3
mturk_agent_1,"I really need 2 waters too, I have my 3 kids with me and we literally won't be able to shower or wash without it. How about 2 water for me, 2 firewood and 1 food?",344,3
mturk_agent_2,ahhh that water is such a necessity.... how about 3 water for me and 3 water and firewood for you?,344,4
mturk_agent_1,Alright I'll take that deal.,344,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,344,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,344,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I'm excited to go camping!",345,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I am very pleased to meet you. I am very excited about our camping trip. Since I was little I liked camping, because I could eat all the food that I don't normally do when I'm at home.",345,0
mturk_agent_1,That's nice! My kids love camping too because of the food- most it's for the s'mores though I think.,345,1
mturk_agent_2,"I hope to go with my family to the camp. We are a very large family, we are my wife, my four children and me. I like camping. A big part of that for me is that I can eat food. If I don't eat, I don't enjoy it, so camping is basically a buffet for me. I am quite determined to have at least 3 food packages. I can offer you what you need in return, We can do a business where we all benefit.",345,1
mturk_agent_1,"I have kids too so I understand it is difficult when you don't have food around! I think we may be able to work that out, I need extra water to make mixed drinks for the kids.",345,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, it seems that we are reaching a good business, however, before doing a business I like to meet people. What do you think if in the camp we get together and have a meeting between your family and mine? We can have a small party to get to know each other better.",345,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds good, hopefully the kids will entertain each other, that's the best part of camping for me.",345,3
mturk_agent_2,"How many members are in your household? To make a proposal taking into account the food, water and firewood you need according to your family group in the camp.",345,3
mturk_agent_1,"We're one less than you (wife, myself and 3 kids). I'm OK with giving you all the food if I take all the water. Can I also get 2 of the 3 wood for the fire? I'm not joking about all the s'mores my kids like to eat.",345,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, it seems like a good deal, but if you want we can talk a little more about what we will do with our families in the camp.",345,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,345,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,345,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! I'd like 3 packages of food and 3 packages of firewood. You can take all of the water in exchange. I'd need the food and firewood as backup for my original supply in case of an emergency, but the water I can get if I bring a filtering system on my own. 🙂",346,0
mturk_agent_2,"Since my partner is suffering with cold , If I get all 3 Firewood  would be helpful..My father and 2 year baby need some additional food as well..So I take all 3 firewood and Food..You take all water",346,0
mturk_agent_1,"I don't need any water as it would only add to the weight I'd be carrying on my trip. Food is the most important priority for me, as I can't easily get more while out in the wilderness. I could get all 2 food, and all of the water. In exchange, you can have all of the firewood and 1 food.",346,1
mturk_agent_2,ok I agree with that🙂,346,1
mturk_agent_1,"In that case, it would be: 2 food for me, 3 water. For you, 3 firewood and 1 food. All good? 🙂",346,2
mturk_agent_2,If you can accept 2 food for me along with 3 firewood..it will be fine,346,2
mturk_agent_1,"That isn't the original deal, so I would have to disagree. ☹️ Food is very important for me as well, and although I would prefer all 3 food, I would be willing to go down to 2 food and no firewood for an agreement.",346,3
mturk_agent_2,ok let us make it final..2 3 firewood and 1 food for me..is that ok ?,346,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's perfect, I agree. 🙂",346,4
mturk_agent_2,ok..thanks🙂,346,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, what about I get 2 packages of food, 2 of water, and you can have the rest and all the firewood.",347,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I don't need extra firewood.  I'll only use it to cook, due to the weather being cooperative and pleasant.🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂",347,0
mturk_agent_1,What do you need? 😮,347,1
mturk_agent_2,"Since I have a child with me, I'd more food and water.  If it's okay with you, would you take 2 firewood, 1 pack of water and food?  I hate to be so needy, but I have another mouth to feed. I hope you understand.",347,1
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, but I also have a few extra mouths to feed. ☹️ What if I took 2 food packs, 1 water, and 2 firewood?",347,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh wow, really. 😮We agree on you taking 2 firewoods and 1 water, but I'm still trying to decide on how to do the food.  Now that I know we're in the same boat. We're camping for two nights and could definitely use 2 packages of food.🙂",347,2
mturk_agent_1,"We are planning a 3 day weekend of fishing, I'm not sure if we will be able to catch enough to supplement. Maybe if we took 3 firewood, 2 water, and 1 food so we would spend less time looking for firewood and making the water potable.",347,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'd take that deal, but it leaves with no firewood.  We definitely would need at least one would get us through out two planned nights.  I'll see if I can ask someone else.  You go ahead and take the 3 firewoods and we can setlle on you getting the 1 food package and water that we previously agreed on.  How does that sound?",347,3
mturk_agent_1,"I could take 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood, in that case. 🙂",347,4
mturk_agent_2,Sounds great! We have a deal.🙂Thank you and enoy your trip.,347,4

mturk_agent_1,"I'm alright. Before we get into negotiating, what are your preferences?",348,1
mturk_agent_2,My priorities are food and water.,348,1
mturk_agent_1,Okay. Mine is firewood and food. ,348,2
mturk_agent_2,Okay. I don't need much firewood. Is there a reason you need extra food?,348,2
mturk_agent_1,Mine is more so for snacks and to make some s'mores for my family - we need all the necessary ingredients for that as you can imagine.,348,3
mturk_agent_2,We have 3 kids as well and have the same concerns. I'd be happy to give you 2 firewood for making s'mores.,348,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I was actually thinking of giving you all the food in exchange for all the firewood?",348,4
mturk_agent_2,That would work. 🙂 What would you like to do with the water?,348,4
mturk_agent_1,"Whoops, my apologies. I meant all the water. We have other drinks and some water from home.",348,5
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, I can't give up all the water. I don't want the kids getting dehydrated. ☹️",348,5
mturk_agent_1,"No, I meant I take all the firewood, you take all the water.",348,6
mturk_agent_2,So confused... what about the food?,348,6
mturk_agent_1,"That's a good point, my apologies. can I take 2 firewood, 2 food, 0 water?",348,7
mturk_agent_2,Could you take 3 firewood and 1 food?,348,7
mturk_agent_1,Sure. What do you think about the water though?,348,8
mturk_agent_2,"If you don't need it, we could certainly use it.",348,8
mturk_agent_1,Sure. 3 firewood + 1 food + 0 water for me.,348,9
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,348,9
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,348,10
mturk_agent_1,"I hope you and your party are as excited about this trip, but we need to figure out how to share these supplies! ",349,0
mturk_agent_2,Are you looking for any specific items?,349,0
mturk_agent_1,"Well, we will be near Mt. Getscoldthere and I know it's supposed to be unseasonably cold.  We are definitely in need of the firewood. 🙂",349,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm traveling with a large family and kids love to sit next to campfire at night.,349,1
mturk_agent_1,"We have a party of 10 and one of them is anemic, whose condition is really exacerbated in the cold.  The other thing we are in pretty desperate need is water.  Thankfully, we are pretty good on food overall.",349,2
mturk_agent_2,In that case I would love to keep all of the food. ,349,2
mturk_agent_1,I think we can definitely consider that.  It's just a matter of hashing out the details on the other two items.,349,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about I get one wood, three food, and 1 water and you keep the rest.",349,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think that could work.  It's a little less firewood than I was hoping, but I think we can get creative with how we use it.",349,4
mturk_agent_2,"Perfect, let's do a deal.",349,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,349,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,349,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello! What camping supplies are you looking for the most?,35,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I would like more packages of food the most. What are you looking for?,35,0
mturk_agent_1,"I would need water the most as I forgot to bring enough. I can give you all my food for all of you water, if you'd like?",35,1
mturk_agent_2,"That would be amazing! So I could take all 3 packages of the food and you could have all 3 packages of the water. Now, we just need to split the firewood. Could I take 2 of the firewood leaving you with 1? I think I would need more for cooking the food. ",35,1
mturk_agent_1,Awesome! That does sound like a deal. I wish we had more firewood to split because I am afraid it might get cold.,35,2
mturk_agent_2,"I know, it makes it a little hard to split the supplies with only 3 of everything. I would definitely share more if there were more supplies!",35,2
mturk_agent_1,"I agree. I am feeling generous and I did buy a new axe for this camping trip. So, I could stick to the prior agreement and just work a little harder to find some dry trees to chop.",35,3
mturk_agent_2,I appreciate your generosity 🙂 I think that bringing your axe would be a great idea! Also be sure to pack warm clothes and extra blankets! I'm sure we will both be fine,35,3
mturk_agent_1,You are welcome! 🙂 I am happy that we reached an agreement! Did you happen to see any dry looking trees on along your way?,35,4
mturk_agent_2,"I am also happy we reached an agreement so easily! You are a great partner for compromising! Honestly, I am not sure how to tell if the trees look dry but I would definitely help you go look for some. I will submit our original deal so we can get on with camping🙂🙂",35,4
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you! Stay safe out there! If you need anything else, let me know.",35,5
mturk_agent_2,You as well! Have fun!,35,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,35,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,35,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello?,350,0
mturk_agent_2,Howdy,350,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi friend,350,1
mturk_agent_2,"Let's get to it, I could really use additional water for this camping trip. My wife is pregnant and has to drink a lot of water to stay healthy. Would you do a 2/1 split?",350,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm not sure if I could do that. I also need water because I get dehydrated easily. Maybe if I can get 3 food then I'll give you 2 water?,350,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can do 2 water, 1 food, 1 firewood for me and 1 water, 2 food, and 2 firewood for you. You make out with one additional piece of equipment.  ",350,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you for trying to be fair but I need an extra food, I need to maintain my blood sugar so I don't pass out while hiking ☹️",350,3
mturk_agent_2,I can't do zero food so looks like we are at a standstill.,350,3
mturk_agent_1,Ok you said your wife is pregnant so it sounds like she shouldn't be exercising heavily. I'm sure if she isn't exerting herself hard she will do well with less water. Could you give me one extra water and I'll give you 2 food?,350,4
mturk_agent_2,"To recap we are at 1 water, 2 food for me and 2 water 1 food for you?",350,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes that is correct , if that is fine with you then we can talk about the firewood.🙂",350,5
mturk_agent_2,well since you are getting 2 water I think I should get 2 firewood,350,5
mturk_agent_1,Ok I don't need too much firewood so that will be fine,350,6
mturk_agent_2,"Perfect, 1 water, 2 food 2 wood for me, 2 water, 1 food, 1 wood for you.",350,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,350,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,350,7
mturk_agent_2,Hello!  Are you excited for the camping trip this weekend?!,351,0
mturk_agent_1,hello. yeah i'm very excited about camping trip,351,0
mturk_agent_2,"Awesome, me too!  Would you mind sharing your top priority item with me so that we can try to come up with a good way to divide all these extra goods>",351,1
mturk_agent_1,i don't have any back up for water. so my first and most priority is water,351,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, actually I am the same unfortunately.  I need water the most since I have a huge family with me.  Would you be okay with accepting only 1 water but 2 of your next priority item and 2 of your last priority item?",351,2
mturk_agent_1,i also had very big family. can you please tell me how much water is required for you?,351,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would prefer to have 2 of the packages of water if possible?  I literally am going camping as a family reunion so my parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, and two grandparents will all be there, believe it or not!",351,3
mturk_agent_1,okay fine. then i have 1 water. also i need of 2 pack of food and 2 pack of firewood. Are you okay with this?,351,3
mturk_agent_2,Yup that should be okay.  I will take 2 waters but 1 fire and 1 food,351,4
mturk_agent_1,okay. sounds good,351,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,351,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,351,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I hope you are well. I was hoping to get some packages from you. How does 3 packages of firewood, 2 packages of food, and 2 packages of water sound?",352,0
mturk_agent_2,"That's a steep price. That you would give you 7 items and me only 4. I think we can work something out if you're willing to compromise though. Food is very important to me. If you are asking for 3 packages of firewood, I'd like 3 packages of food.",352,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm not sure about that offer. I do need food as well, but water is not my number one priority. Would you be willing to give 3 packages of firewood, 1 package of food, and no water?",352,1
mturk_agent_2,Let me consider. I miscalculated on my first statement - your initial offer would leave me with only 2(!) items. But this is more reasonable. I assume you value water the least?,352,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes! Firewood is my top priority, along with food. What do you need most?",352,2
mturk_agent_2,"Food is highest, and a critical resource of course. 🙂 Last time I went camping, some of it spoiled. Firewood is least of my concerns since it's very hot where I live right now, so I'm willing to let you have all 3 of that.",352,2
mturk_agent_1,Awesome! Firewood is much needed because it gets very cold at night here.,352,3
mturk_agent_2,"But you still need some food. You're asking me to give 1 package of food, 3 firewood, but no water? Does that offer still stand?",352,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I think that will work in favor of us both. What do you think?",352,4
mturk_agent_2,"I think I can work with that. So, just to be sure we're on the same page, you will get 3 firewood, 1 food, 0 water. I will get 0 firewood, 2 food, 3 water.",352,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that is the deal on the table.",352,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,352,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,352,6
mturk_agent_2,"I'm always cold so I definitely need more firewood. For health reasons, I also don't want to run out of water. So you can have more of the food which I don't mind going hungry.",353,0
mturk_agent_1,"I forgot to bring my axe with me, so I definitely need more firewood. How about I have 2 and you have 1? Also, how about I have 3 food and 2 of the water.",353,0
mturk_agent_2,Bummer! Well I can definitely see that you'd need some firewood so I can settle for just 2 of them. But I'd be completely miserable if I got cold and I get cold very easily. My friends always make fun of me for that! 🙂,353,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, we can go with 2 firewood for you, but I will need all 3 of the food if we do that. Can't be cold and hungry lol",353,1
mturk_agent_2,"I don't mind sharing most of it, but not having any extra food isn't really going to work for me. Being warm and starving also not a good way to camp! LOL!",353,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry man, I need to have all of the food ( I have a legit medical condition that requires me to eat), or all of the firewood (I forgot my axe:( . Unless we go with 2 firewood for me and 2 of the food... I could also go for that.🙂",353,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm in the same boat with the food. I have to monitor my blood sugar closely and if I run into trouble, then best case scenario is that I'll be spending the rest of my camping trip in the ER. Is your medical condition so urgent that you need all of it? Or just need to make sure you have some extra?",353,3
mturk_agent_1,"Wow, that's so hard. Health issues stink huh? I could go with 2 of the firewood 1 of the food and 2 of the water if that would work for you?",353,3
mturk_agent_2,They sure do. I appreciate your understanding on that. Don't want you to go without. But I do still need at least 2 of the firewood. ☹️,353,4
mturk_agent_1,I think it's fair if let you have 2 of the food to give me 2 of the firewood.☹️ I'll do 2 of the wood or 2 of the food. Gotta have something haha,353,4
mturk_agent_2,I thought we were closer to a deal with 2 firewood for me and 2 food for you? I just didn't want to be stuck with no food. Does that work for you?,353,5
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, 2 firewood for you, and 2 food for me. If we do that though, I will need 2 of the water.",353,5
mturk_agent_2,I thought you were okay with the water division? That's part of the health issue for me so that's going to be tough to only have 1. ☹️,353,6
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry to be so difficult haha, but if you're going to have 2 of the highest valued item, I need at least 2 of the water... Not to be pushy, but we really need to make a deal soon or else we'll both lose out.",353,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,353,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,353,7
mturk_agent_1,hi🙂,354,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I'm wondering if I can get extra food or firewood for my upcoming camping trip?",354,0
mturk_agent_1,"First though, can you tell me your preferences ranking for the 3 items?",354,1
mturk_agent_2,I generally prefer food for emergencies and extra firewood for better fires and cooking.,354,1
mturk_agent_1,I think 3 water for me and 3 food for you is a good starting point,354,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think that can work out, fresh water is easy to adequately clean in my experience.",354,2
mturk_agent_1,Now we're left with 3 firefood for 2 people☹️,354,3
mturk_agent_2,"Feel free to take the leftover firewood, I think one extra unit is enough for us. 🙂",354,3
mturk_agent_1,wow that's generous of you,354,4
mturk_agent_2,"No problem, we're all just trying to get the most out of our camping right? Haha.",354,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,354,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,354,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! We're a rather large group camping in the summer and we'll need to conserve water. We have plenty of food, however!",355,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I need water also because the stream dried up! I could use food! ,355,0
mturk_agent_2,Gotcha. How about I give you all 3 of the food packages if you'll share the water with us. You can have two firewood bundles and a water package.,355,1
mturk_agent_1,That sounds great to me! Thanks for trading.,355,1
mturk_agent_2,OK. Sounds good. I'll make the adjustments. Is firewood needed just about as much as the water or moreso?,355,2
mturk_agent_1,"I need water more but I’m glad to let you have 2, I’ll get by 🙂",355,2
mturk_agent_2,Sounds fair to us! Please reply and I'll send these items over to your group.,355,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok,let me get your items ready",355,3
mturk_agent_2,Thanks. Glad we could make this work.,355,4
mturk_agent_1,Me too!,355,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,355,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,355,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I am thinking that we should try to split everything as close to 50/50 as possible",356,0
mturk_agent_2,could you try for 70/30 possibilities,356,0
mturk_agent_1,"2 items 70/30 your way, one item 70/30 my way.  Which item do you have the highest preference for? ",356,1
mturk_agent_2,Food and water is my highest preference. firewood is least thing ,356,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, firewood is my highest priority, so we can work this out 🙂",356,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes me too think that this is the best🙂,356,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay cool, I think once we reach the minimum of messages, we can submit the deal.  ",356,3
mturk_agent_2,"yes, sure Thanks for the understanding the deal ",356,3
mturk_agent_1,No problem.  Our priorities were different so we were able to make a mutually beneficial deal. ,356,4
mturk_agent_2,yes our mutual understanding makes us both beneficiaries in best way,356,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,356,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,356,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you?",357,0
mturk_agent_2,Doing well!  How are you?,357,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm doing good. What kind of packages are you looking for? 🙂,357,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I get really cold when I am outside, so I was hoping for two packages of firewood, two packages of water and one package of food. 🙂",357,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, that makes sense. I have some friends that have decided to come and meet me at the camp, so I was hoping to get some extra water and food, but I could probably spare some firewood.",357,2
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds like so much fun, having friends come over.  Would you be willing to let me have all the firewood in exchange for all the food? ",357,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, I will definitely need the extra water for them, though. Would it be possible to get all of the water in exchange for all of the firewood? 🙂",357,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'm worried that I would get thirsty, though.  I am going on a long hike in the afternoon, and I will need to hydrate.   What if you got two of the waters and all the food, and I got all the firewood and one of the waters?",357,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think I could do that, that makes sense! Would you like to agree on that then?",357,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that would be great! That way I will be warm and hydrated and you and your friends will have plenty to eat and drink! 🙂",357,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,357,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,357,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I'm looking forward to making a trade with you that's good for both of us.,358,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi! sounds like a good plan.,358,0
mturk_agent_1,"So for me, I'd really like to have all of the food. I'm bringing my whole family, and I'm going to do a lot of hiking, so we can't have anyone starving. We have really fast metabolisms. What do you want most of?",358,1
mturk_agent_2,I brought a lot of food for home but really needing water more than anything and a little food but not much. ,358,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, so if I take 2 foods and you take 1 food, then I can take 1 water and you can take 2 waters. How's that?",358,2
mturk_agent_2,That sound fair to me. ,358,2
mturk_agent_1,"Wonderful. And what about the firewood? I'd like at least 2 of those, since it'll be freezing cold here and I really need to keep warm.",358,3
mturk_agent_2,"I am in the same boat with the firewood, not sure can stay warm with just 1.",358,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, well if I give you 2 firewood, can I take all of the food? I definitely need food the most, and can sacrific that wood if you really need it.",358,4
mturk_agent_2,I am willing to do that as food I think I will be OK on. So I will have 2 waters and 2 firewood and you will have 1 of each of those and the the 3 food?,358,4
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like a good deal to me, and I'm happy with that if you are.",358,5

mturk_agent_2,Hi there.  I'm looking forward to this camping trip.,359,0
mturk_agent_1,Me too. Which item do you need the most?,359,1
mturk_agent_2,I really need all 3 of the extra firewood because we are staying longer than planned.  I also would like 1 extra FRood,359,1
mturk_agent_1,hmmm,359,2
mturk_agent_2,I know but we got this opportunity to stay three more nights and won't be able to camp again this year.,359,2
mturk_agent_1,"I really need extra firewood too. How about I take 3 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food, and you can have all of the rest?",359,3
mturk_agent_2,"Would you be willing to throw in one of the water so you would have 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food?",359,3
mturk_agent_1,That would be difficult for me. I need firewood the most but I am willing to let you have 2 of them if you can agree to my previous offer.,359,4

mturk_agent_1,"I'm good as well, trying to plan my camping trip for the weekend. Do you enjoy camping?",36,1
mturk_agent_2,I do but it's hotter than I expected. Probably gonna drink a lot of water.,36,1
mturk_agent_1,It pretty cool where I live so I don't need many water. But I do need a lot of food and firewood. Have a huge family and we do a lot of grilling. ,36,2
mturk_agent_2,I would give you all the wood if I could have all of the water.,36,2
mturk_agent_1,"I do need more food than firewood, If I could get 3 food and 2 firewood. You can get 3 water and 1 firewood.",36,3
mturk_agent_2,I do need some food. I would like to get at least 1 food. You can still get 3 firewood.,36,3
mturk_agent_1,"I could use water as well, so I could get 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood",36,4
mturk_agent_2,I am good at making fire and have a starter so I can give up all the wood.,36,4

mturk_agent_1,"I might be able to help you out, but I also am low on water, turned out 2 of my bottles had a leak. I could use some firewood myself",360,0
mturk_agent_2,Mmm I also value firewood but I could be willing to give you some,360,1
mturk_agent_1,I could give you 1 water and 1 food for 2 firewood,360,1
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds like a good deal to me, although I would give you 3 firewood for 1 water and 2 food",360,2
mturk_agent_1,"that sounds like a great deal to me, are you sure you can spare that? what do you need the most?",360,2
mturk_agent_2,I need water the most and then food,360,3
mturk_agent_1,okay i think 1 water and 2 food for 3 of your firewood sounds like a deal to me 🙂,360,3
mturk_agent_2,Thank you! I assumed you needed firewood the most. We just need one more message I think,360,4
mturk_agent_1,"yes firewood is something I need , so looks like we all do well on this deal",360,4

mturk_agent_2,Hi there! I sure am getting excited for camping! How about you?,361,0
mturk_agent_1,Hey! I am so excited about camping. Been really boring the last few months,361,0
mturk_agent_2,No kidding! Corona is making me crave the outdoors! I can't wait to eat smore's while camping! I was hoping you might let me have all of the food and firewood?,361,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'd like for you to have some, but that's just too big of an ask",361,1
mturk_agent_2,I understand. Can I have two of the food and two of the firewood?,361,2
mturk_agent_1,I actually need to have some of the firewood. It gets really cold at night where we camp. How about 2 firewood 0 water and 2 food,361,2
mturk_agent_2,I will gladly accept 2 firewood and 2 food! Or is that what you are asking for from me?,361,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, you get 2 firewood and 2 food",361,3
mturk_agent_2,That would be great! Thanks! So what are you most excited about on your trip?,361,4
mturk_agent_1,"Fishing, it's been a long while",361,4

mturk_agent_2,Firewood is my greatest need. What is yours? 🙂,362,0
mturk_agent_1,I also need firewood! We'll have to figure out a fair way to split the firewood. What about your second priority item?,362,1
mturk_agent_2,Yikes! Okay we should be able to work a fair deal. My next item is food...,362,1
mturk_agent_1,Okay! I need water second.,362,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh perfect! I don't need water so I'd be willing to give you all 3 🙂 so long as I get 3 water... ?,362,2
mturk_agent_1,I'm open to something like that...we need to split the firewood 2 to 1 though.,362,3
mturk_agent_2,I meant firewood not water. Okay that works. 2 firewood for me and 3 food. 3 water and 1 firewood for you?,362,3
mturk_agent_1,How about you give me 1 food as well since there is an uneven firewood split?,362,4
mturk_agent_2,I can work with that. Either way there are 9 items so it could never be split evenly. 🙂,362,4
mturk_agent_1,"I know! ☹️ So are you okay with the following trade: 1 firewood, 3 water, 1 food for me. 2 firewood, 2 food for you. Sound good? 🙂",362,5

mturk_agent_2,I need as much food as possible. I could use a little water but I don't need any firewood either,363,1
mturk_agent_1,I can give you 2 units of water if I can get 2 units of food?,363,1
mturk_agent_2,I think that's fair,363,2
mturk_agent_1,I am sorry about that. Reverse that. Can I get 2 units of water and give you 2 units of food?,363,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh yes, I misread that as well. 2 food for me, 2 water for you",363,3
mturk_agent_1,How do you want to split the firewood?,363,3
mturk_agent_2,"Can I take 2 of the 3? I need it a little, though not a lot. You mentioned not needing any. ",363,4
mturk_agent_1,"Could you tell me more about why you need 2 of the 3? I am open to giving you them, but I am not sure yet.",363,4

mturk_agent_1,Would you mind telling me what you need the water for?,364,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I have a friend that will be visiting but I really only brought enough for myself ",364,2
mturk_agent_1,"Oh of course. As for me, it's going to be dangerously hot here, and I just need to have some extra water so we don't get heat exhaustion.",364,2
mturk_agent_2,"I know food is a need, but what if I give you another food?  So you would get 1 water, 3 food?  Then I would get 2 water and 3 firewood?",364,3
mturk_agent_1,"I can agree to that. That sounds fair to me, if that sounds fair to you?",364,3

mturk_agent_2,"Hi there! I hope you're having a good day. My top priority is firewood. I was hoping to have all three bundles if possible, as I'm going camping in the mountains. I'm more than happy to let you have extra water. What is your second priority?",369,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm ok with letting go of two extra bundles of the firewood, if you'd be willing to let me have just one of them?",369,1
mturk_agent_2,Are you willing to bend on that at all? I could let you have 2 water and 2 food in exchange for me getting all three extra firewood. I'm flexible though. ,369,1
mturk_agent_1,Ok after thinking I'd be willing to give you all 3 firewood if I can have all three water and 2 food. I don't know how to fish or hunt so the food package may help me more than the firewood as well.,369,2
mturk_agent_2,Certainly! I actually do know how to fish or hunt. I know I can make do with just one pack of food. I've had survival training as well. ,369,2
mturk_agent_1,Ok that's great! 🙂,369,3
mturk_agent_2,"So let's just review this before we agree on things. You get 0 firewood, 3 water, and 2 food. I get 3 firewood, 0 water, and 1 food for our respective trips. Is that what you want me to offer?",369,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I was just going to confirm this as well. ME = 0 firewood, 3 water, and 2 food. YOU= 3 firewood, 0 water, and 1 food. I agree to this if you do as well. ",369,4

mturk_agent_1,But then you get more items than me. I'm already giving you your top thing give me some compromise. ,372,3
mturk_agent_2,"What if you have all the firewood, and I get all of the water? You will receive more of a higher value item",372,3
mturk_agent_1,I'll take all the firewood and two waters and you can have all the food. I think that's a good deal for you. ,372,4

mturk_agent_1,"That is not going to work for me, I need to have water to stay hydrated- I could maybe give up 1 water.",373,2
mturk_agent_2,How about i take 2 waters 1 firewood and 1 food that still leaves you with some water and a lot of firewood and food,373,3
mturk_agent_1,"Naah, that wont work for me, I was hoping to get some water from you, and firewood also- ",373,3
mturk_agent_2,OK i can take 1 water 2 firewood and 2 food that leaves most of the water for you ,373,4

mturk_agent_2,i am sorry that leaves me with almost nothing ,373,5
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you 1 water, 1 firewood, and 3 food- how does that sound?",373,5
mturk_agent_2,that sounds marginal - how about 1 water 2 firewood and 2 food just trade a firewood for food,373,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,373,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,373,7
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I would love to have additional food to allow me sustinance and time to track down additional water near by. With out it I will not have the energy to find it.,374,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I know that food is a pretty high priority since we have a Type 2 diabetic in the party.  We are really close to Lake Gottalottawatta, are you not by a clean source of water?",374,0
mturk_agent_1,The water is not very clean. I would need to make a fire to boil the water first. We also have a five year old child who cannot fast for long periods.,374,1
mturk_agent_2,"I would be more than happy for you to take all the additional water you wanted.  Not sure if you have been to that lake, but it gets very breezy and cold.  I am going to need a lot of firewood and food for this trip.",374,1
mturk_agent_1,"I understand you need firewood, but I certainly cannot be without food. I would be willing to give up firewood in hopes I could collect some on the way to the creek - but cannot give up any food.",374,2
mturk_agent_2,How many people are in your party?,374,2
mturk_agent_1,We have nine people. How about yourself? Do you have any elderly people?,374,3
mturk_agent_2,"We have eight including me, with my brother-in-law, being the diabetic. We are all in our 30s and 40s, but various degrees of health.",374,3
mturk_agent_1,I have been near the lake and know there is quite a bit of firewood and that its relatively heavy. We have many elderluy in our group that would only be able to carry the fire wood back if they first have enough food to be energized. Otherwise we will need to keep all our firewood and most of our food.,374,4
mturk_agent_2,"Let me send you a deal that may be amicable for our parties.  I totally understand your predicament.  How about I take the firewood, you take the water, and get two food while I take 1?",374,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds okay. I would agree to that.,374,5

mturk_agent_1,It's a nice place but a bit deserted this time of year,375,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, I assume the virus mess is keeping some people away. But thats why I chose to come out here now for my sanity!",375,1
mturk_agent_1,Did you forget anything? One of my group chickened out at the last moment and he was bringing extra food so we could use some if you can spare any😮,375,2
mturk_agent_2,"😮 Oh that sucks, cause I too forgot to pack the pack with some of my food and cooking fuel. Perhaps we could split the food. How are you for fire wood?",375,2
mturk_agent_1,"We have too much firewood, we hate carrying it around anyways. We cam always some water too although the food is more important",375,3
mturk_agent_2,"Perhaps we can do some kind of win-win. Maybe 2 foods to you, 3 waters, and then all the wood for me? Once we're done maybe could check out the trails.",375,3
mturk_agent_1,"Thank sounds like a great deal to me, let's do it🙂",375,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok🙂. Sounds good to me too. So would you put in 2 food, 3 waters, and 0 firewood on your end? Then we can get down to camping in the wild🙂",375,4

mturk_agent_1,I need water as well,376,1
mturk_agent_2,How about I give you 2 packets of food and 2 packets of firewood instead of water. I will have all water and 1 food and 1 firewood,376,2
mturk_agent_1,no i need water as well How about we split the water,376,2
mturk_agent_2,I need firewood too but I am ready to give you that. I must have all the water because we have more friends joining our camp and we would not have enough ☹️,376,3
mturk_agent_1,I need more water as well becuase I drink a lot of water and I need it to cook with as well. How about I give you 2 waters and you give me all of the firewood and we split the food,376,3
mturk_agent_2,No that is not reasonable at all. As I said even I need some firewood but I am giving you everything. How about I have 2 waters and 3 food and you take all firewood and 1 water,376,4
mturk_agent_1,no thats not fair at all. I need food as well. How about I give you 2 water and 2 food. You give me 3 firewoods and 1 food and 1 water. ,376,4

mturk_agent_2,"I definitely want to take at least 1 firewood, since it's going to be so cold. What do you need all of it for?",377,0
mturk_agent_1,I am allergic to cold and it is freezing out here. ,377,1
mturk_agent_2,"I understand. Then can I take all of the food? I will have 2 children with me, and we will be doing a lot of activity, so I can't have anyone starving.",377,1
mturk_agent_1,That is fine. then we can share the water. I take 2 you take 1,377,2
mturk_agent_2,"Since you get all of the firewood, I'd like 2 water, and you can take 1. I think that's more fair. Do you agree?",377,2
mturk_agent_1,I feel that is fair enough.,377,3
mturk_agent_2,Wonderful. I appreciate the compromise and I look forward to making the trade.,377,3
mturk_agent_1,Me too. Thanks for helping me out and being understanding,377,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello,378,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how are you? Do you need extra firewood to keep warm and maybe have a bonfire?",378,0
mturk_agent_2,I am good. Yes I do need extra firewood and food because I have a large group that will be hungry,378,1
mturk_agent_1,"I have diabetes and have to have several small meals. Without food, I pass out. ",378,1
mturk_agent_2,Ok I do not need all the food. I would be willing to give you more in exchange for extra firewood and water,378,2
mturk_agent_1,I would be ok with 2 food and a couple of waters. That would leave you with plenty for your party. 🙂,378,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok I would be ok with getting 1 package of food and water. Since you are getting the majority of those, do I get to take all the firewood for my bonfire?",378,3
mturk_agent_1,Would you mind if I sit by the fire some to warm up before going to bed?,378,3
mturk_agent_2,You mean by the bonfire? I wouldn't mind at all!,378,4
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds wonderful! 🙂 I really do need the food. So, would you be ok with me having the food and a couple of the waters. You can have all the wood and a water? 🙂",378,4
mturk_agent_2,I would prefer to have at least one package of food as I have a large group and need some food to feed. I think you having two packages of water and two packages of food is fairly split up. Do you agree?,378,5
mturk_agent_1,Can I have 1 of the firewood then so I can warm my food?,378,5
mturk_agent_2,I think the original deal is fine and you can warm your food with my fire. So you take all the food and the majority of water with me taking the firewood and a package of the water. Is that fair?,378,6

mturk_agent_2,Hey there! I'm going camping in an extremely hot part of the country and would really like to have the most of water.,379,0
mturk_agent_1,You can have 2 waters as long as I get 2 food. I have really hungry teenage boys coming with me and need as much as I can get. ,379,1
mturk_agent_2,Would you like to have three food if I keep three waters?,379,1
mturk_agent_1,I don't think that's necessarily fair since my boys will also need some extra water since they're running around a lot. I think the 2 and 2 deal is the most fair. ,379,2
mturk_agent_2,Got it!,379,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok so right now, we're at you have 2 water and 1 food, and I have 1 water and 2 food",379,3
mturk_agent_2,"If you're okay with it, I'm going to need the fires at night to keep the wildlife away. Could I do two wood for me and one for you?",379,3
mturk_agent_1,Having two firewood is important for me also,379,4
mturk_agent_2,How do you think we should settle this?,379,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,379,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,379,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you doing?",38,0
mturk_agent_1,I’m doing fine. How about you?,38,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm doing well. I was hoping I could have the extra firewood because my group decided to camp for a few extra days and want to make sure we have enough,38,1
mturk_agent_1,How many of you are on the camping grounds?,38,1
mturk_agent_2,It's just my family. There are 6 of us total,38,2
mturk_agent_1,Wow. I’m alone here. I could use an extra food and water. ,38,2
mturk_agent_2,How many would you like? I just want to make sure we have enough good and water because there are so many of us,38,3
mturk_agent_1,I understand. I would like one food and one water. How much wood do you want for that?,38,3
mturk_agent_2,I think we could get by with two pieces of wood and I would be glad to give you the other one,38,4
mturk_agent_1,So you will give me one piece of each?,38,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes that sounds good with me if that is good with you,38,5
mturk_agent_1,So I’ll give you one wood and you give me one food and one water. ,38,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,38,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,38,6
mturk_agent_2,I would like to get extra water because I tend to sweat a lot and this makes me dehydrated. ,380,0
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I can agree to that.  I'm camped out next to a stream so extra water is less important for me.",380,0
mturk_agent_2,What is your high priority item? I am willing to give extra firewood. ,380,1
mturk_agent_1,I prefer extra food because I will have some friends joining me in a few days.  Firewood is also somewhat important for me though.,380,1
mturk_agent_2,How many friends are you expecting? I have a pretty large family with me. ,380,2
mturk_agent_1,"2-5, I'm not entirely sure yet.",380,2
mturk_agent_2,"I have my ma (she's getting up there in age), my husband and our two kids. Then I have my two little sisters. And me of course. I would like to have a little extra food to feed them all.  ",380,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I understand.  We all want to be safe and not run out of food.  How much do you need firewood?",380,3
mturk_agent_2,Firewood isn't so much a priority. I'm willing to give up some of it if you're in need.,380,4
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, hmm.  Can I have all the firewood and 2 food items?  Then you can have all the water and the 1 extra food?",380,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,380,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,380,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I'd love to get as much firewood as possible - it's been chilly here and the warmth from a fire would be great!,381,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello.  I can give you 1 firewood. I have an extreme fear of the dark and need the firewood to prevent an anxiety attack.,381,0
mturk_agent_2,"What about water? What if I give you 2 firewoods, 1 water, and 1 food?",381,1
mturk_agent_1,Happy with the 2 firewoods and 1 water.  Can I take 2 foods though? The food that I packed for the trip was stolen from my car as I was unloading.,381,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that should be okay. 🙂",381,2
mturk_agent_1,"🙂 OK. Do you need any extra food, or could I take all 3 foods?",381,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would love some extra food! What if we did 2 firewoods, 1 water, and 2 foods for you; 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 1 food for me?",381,3
mturk_agent_1,"That works for me. so to confirm I'll take 2 firewoods, 1 water, and 2 foods ",381,3
mturk_agent_2,"Perfect, that sounds like a plan!",381,4
mturk_agent_1,awesome thanks🙂,381,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,381,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,381,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi! 🙂 How are you today? What items do you need?,382,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi I'm fine, I hope you are great too. Let's work together to find an offer that suits both of us.🙂",382,0
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds good! I need firewood the most, water medium, and food the least. What about you?",382,1
mturk_agent_1,The article that I need the most is water since I need to hydrate myself.,382,1
mturk_agent_2,Awesome! What's your second most needed item?,382,2
mturk_agent_1,The second item that I need the most is firewood because I don't want to be cold at night,382,2
mturk_agent_2,So we are both good on food then. I would be happy to trade you water if you give me firewood!,382,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds good to me, I'll give you an offer and you will tell me if it seems fair ok?🙂",382,3
mturk_agent_2,"Of course! Also, my reasoning for needing firewood is I brought food that requires cooking with fire as well as for warmth like you. ",382,4
mturk_agent_1,"I get 3 water, 1firewood and 1 food, And you  0 Water, 2 Firewood and 2 Food",382,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,382,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,382,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I'm going camping and need extra supplies. Especially food since my trip is over 10 days.",383,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I'm going camping also and have a decent amount of food. ",383,0
mturk_agent_2,Are you willing to trade some food for water packs?,383,1
mturk_agent_1,That sounds reasonable. How about 2 food packs for one water and three packs of firewood?🙂,383,1
mturk_agent_2,Thats a good deal. How about also a pack of firewood too?,383,2
mturk_agent_1,I have kids that are afraid of the dark. I need the firewood so that they won't get scared at night. ,383,2
mturk_agent_2,I understand. I have kids too and they do get afraid! 🙂 What about 1 pack of food for 2 waters and 3 firewoods,383,3
mturk_agent_1,To be clear. You would get 1 pack of food and I would get 2 waters and 3 firewood?,383,3
mturk_agent_2,"No, I think I confused us both 🙂 I'd like 1 pack of food 2 waters and 0 firewood",383,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds good to me. You get 1 food pack, 2 waters and 0 firewood. And I get 2 packs of food, 1 water and 3 firewood, correct?🙂",383,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,383,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,383,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there, how is it going?",384,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm pretty good, just planning for a trip.",384,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah same here. So, what interests you the most? I like water myself. I'm a thirsty man 🙂",384,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, I am going to a dry area, so I'm hoping to bring a lot of water beforehand.",384,1
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good. How's the food strike you? I'm already overweight. Don't need a whole lot of that personally haha,384,2
mturk_agent_1,I'm a light eater so I don't need a lot. I am looking to get water mostly. Would spare wood and food more water.,384,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, so you prefer water over everything else then?",384,3
mturk_agent_1,I would take 3 ideally but 2 is OK.,384,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about the food? I personally like food. Well, who doesn't. ",384,4
mturk_agent_1,"I would trade all my food for 2 or 3 waters,",384,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,384,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,384,5
mturk_agent_2,i would like to have 3 food 3 firewoos and 3 water,385,0
mturk_agent_1,That is everything.  I don't think that is fair.  How about we split it up.,385,0
mturk_agent_2,ok how about we each get half ,385,1
mturk_agent_1,There are nine items. So we can't split it completely in half.  we will Need to decide how to make it fair. ,385,1
mturk_agent_2,i would like to get the extra water just in case i run out  i wouldnt mind giving up something,385,2
mturk_agent_1,I would like the extra firewood because I stay up late at night😮,385,2
mturk_agent_2,Is that right I would get the extra water and you would get my firewood? I think that would be fair,385,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes.  Now we just need to decide how to split the food.  How about I take two since you have the extra water. ,385,3
mturk_agent_2,"I would think thats not fair, since you have eallready got the extra firewood ",385,4
mturk_agent_1,You have extra food though.,385,4
mturk_agent_2,i can give you i package of extra food but what am i getting in return?,385,5
mturk_agent_1,The extra water.  There is nothing else to offer. ,385,5
mturk_agent_2,Let me see so you got my firewood and extra food ,385,6
mturk_agent_1,How about we keep it at that and you can come by my bonfire and we can share the extra food there.🙂,385,6
mturk_agent_2,Well i'm not really  into bonfires  but that would be definately a good idea,385,7
mturk_agent_1,So are we ready to enter our deal?,385,7
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, i think its fair🙂",385,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,385,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,385,9
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you doing?",386,0
mturk_agent_2,☹️ Not too good. I was robbed earlier before my camping trip with my boy. I need more items so I can take him on a camping trip that I've promised him for almost 6 months now.,386,0
mturk_agent_1,Oh that is a shame. I am currently training for a marathon in Greenland and I am trying to maintain my weight during this trip. What did they steal from you?,386,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well after leaving the grocery, I put my groceries in my car and then got into the driver's seat. When I sat down, a man pointed his gun at me and told me to put my wallet in the center console and then get out the car. He took my car, wallet and all of my groceries. There were 3 packages of water, 3 bundles of firewood and 3 packages of food. ",386,1
mturk_agent_1,"I hope they catch that guy, well since you are close to our campsite we could cook something together. My husband brought his bow and fishing rod so I think we plan on getting some more food that way.",386,2
mturk_agent_2,"🙂That would be really nice of you, but my son is grown. He has a hearty appetite. I really need to feed him his snacks because he is Austic and throws tantrums if he doesn't eat particular foods. Same goes with water. ",386,2
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, our nephew has autism as well but not much of an appetite. We could also let you borrow the fishing rod and go out with your son for some bonding time. If you catch a fish or two that could help the trade on how much food I would be willing to give up. I am horribly afraid of darkness, so I would like more than enough firewood.",386,3
mturk_agent_2,"😮If you could provide us with the food, it would be greatly appreciated. I recently lost my job so I was trying to take my boy on a trip to also get my mind off of things. I won't eat throughout the week if you can provide 2 fish; however, if you did have a spare and could make it three, that would be greatly appreciated. One thing about the robbery that makes me really upset is that this guy took our firewood. I walked home after calling the police and was able to stop by a local park. There was some sticks I gathered to bring with us, but it won't last. Any chance you can spare a few bundles?",386,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hmmm, we picked up the firewood when we arrived the campsite because the park rangers do not want people bringing invasive pests to the area. I am horribly terrified of the dark and we are taking this trip for my husbands birthday. If it gets too dark I will not be able to sleep and it will not be good for my mental preparation for my marathon I have at the end of the month. I would really prefer to hand out more food than firewood since my husband is an amazing fisherman and I also enjoy eating squirrel. ",386,4
mturk_agent_2,"Well how about this, I won't bother you about the firewood. I know it is something that seems beneficial to your well being. I can totally relate to that. For me, I would honestly rather any food you can spare, but my concern is water. It being the summer and a drought now, I don't think we'll make it through the weekend without any water. I can't afford any ☹️. Do you think you can possibly provide us with 3 fish and 3 packages of water?",386,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I can give you two packages of food and two waters, we should be okay boiling our water. Since my husband will be hunting for the extra food we will clean it and cook it, so can you give 2 packages of firewood?",386,5
mturk_agent_2,"I have no firewood. I have nothing! I was robbed ☹️. If you want 1 package of firewood, I can give you 1. However, I am going to need more food and water. I have sjorgren's syndrome. It causes me to dry out. My eyes, throat and really my full body gets dried up. Its caused me to convulse in the past and have seizures. If something happens to me when I'm out in the words. Who will take care of my boy? I need to make sure I don't have an accident out there or they may take my son away from me.",386,5
mturk_agent_1,"Well we will be nearby. Camping sounds a little dangerous with your condition. I suggest since you have no supplies to really offer that you stay next to our camp and share our fire. The ranger will give you the firewood upon arrival, if you give up the all 3 packages of firewood I will provide 2 food and 2 waters.",386,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,386,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,386,7
mturk_agent_2,I can't wait to get out of the house this weekend! 🙂,387,0
mturk_agent_1,Yeah🙂Been locked up too long in the house. Wanting to hit the trails for some running!,387,0
mturk_agent_2,I'll be hiking rather than running. But I'll be on the trails as well.,387,1
mturk_agent_1,So I noticed there is some extra things here. I have more than enough food. Would you like that?,387,1
mturk_agent_2,I am more interested in water. I get thirsty on my long hikes.,387,2
mturk_agent_1,How about you take 2 of the waters and I take 1. Then we could do the reverse on the wood (1/2). What do you think?,387,2
mturk_agent_2,And how do we split the food?,387,3
mturk_agent_1,Perhaps the same as the water. 2/1 1/2 and 2/1 (Water Firewood and Food) Thats a rough split. ,387,3
mturk_agent_2,"OK, go ahead and submit that deal please.",387,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well, after this then perhaps you and I can check out the trail. Dont like to run without first walking it. Please submit as I cannot.",387,4

mturk_agent_1,what do you think about this tarde?,388,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm not seeing your trade offer?,388,1
mturk_agent_1,i just need of 2 pack of food and 1 pack of water,388,2
mturk_agent_2,I need more food because I have low blood sugar. Can I get one more pack of food?,388,2
mturk_agent_1,yes you can,388,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'm not sure what the weather would be like on our camping trip, but I think I'll just need one package of firewood. I could always find some twigs or small branches if need be. ",388,3
mturk_agent_1,"i don't need firewood, instead you can give additional pack of food",388,4
mturk_agent_2,"I feel like I'm getting everything I want but you are so nice if you're going to let me walk away with 2 waters, 2 food packages, and 3 firewood packages. 😮",388,4
mturk_agent_1,yes. we can submit our deal. thank you for your valuable time with me,388,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,388,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,388,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, i really need to get more water, food and firewood for this trip. Its very important",389,0
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I also need some water, food, and firewood for the camping trip. Is there any item in particular you need the most?",389,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes i really need the water the most because the last time we went we didn't have enough to do everything like, cooking, drinking, cleaning, bathing and other things. ",389,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I understand. I also need some water, but it would only be for emergencies. How does you getting two and me getting one sound?",389,1
mturk_agent_1,"i understand you need it too, and yes i can agree to that ",389,2
mturk_agent_2,Alright sweet 🙂,389,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay so went about the food, We really need some of that for emergencies, don't want to run",389,3
mturk_agent_2,"Same, I value the food more since running out would be a great inconvenience. I would like two food for sure, and you get one. How does that sound?",389,3
mturk_agent_1,okay that sound like a plan we can do that since you did give me more water ,389,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, as for firewood, I don't really need that much since we are camping. I am willing to see your offer, but I would like one at least.",389,4
mturk_agent_1,okay we both can do one on the wood because i really dont need much either,389,5
mturk_agent_2,"I think one of us has to get the rest of what the other doesn't. Do you mind, if I get two firewood then?",389,5
mturk_agent_1,"yes you are correct, sure you can get two and i'l get one. ",389,6
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks, I wouldn't want to look for firewood while camping since I want to enjoy my time.",389,6

mturk_agent_1,Good!  How are you?,39,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm doing well! Almost ready for my camping trip. Need some more supplies though.,39,1
mturk_agent_1,Which supplies do you need?,39,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I really need water in case we get really thirsty from hiking. I also need firewood in case it gets colder and we need more. It would be cool to have more food added for dessert like s'mores, but it's not really necessary.",39,2
mturk_agent_1,"How about you take all the water and one of the firewoods, and I can have all the food and 2 of the firewoods",39,2
mturk_agent_2,Let me think about it. What supplies do you need?,39,3
mturk_agent_1,"I won't be doing a lot of hiking, but will probably have a few campfires with food",39,3

mturk_agent_2,Is firewood the item you need the most?,390,1
mturk_agent_1,yes i would need more firewood for camping,390,1
mturk_agent_2,"I could give you more firewood if you let me have the food and water. While I could use firewood, I'll stay hydrated and nourished to help my body keep warm.",390,2
mturk_agent_1,I could give you all the 3 of the food packages if you give me all 3 firewoods. How does that sound,390,2
mturk_agent_2,I would like the 3 water as well,390,3
mturk_agent_1,i would like at lease 1 of the waters. I would think it only fair,390,3
mturk_agent_2,I would rather give you 1 of the food,390,4
mturk_agent_1,I dont really need  much food but i dont need some more water. You coul have 2 water an i would only get one?,390,4
mturk_agent_2,"Water is my most valued item. If you get all of your most valued, I'd want all of mine",390,5

mturk_agent_1,Excellent! thank you for asking,391,1
mturk_agent_2,"I am in extra need of food and water. You see, I have a baby and a toddler who eats often! Would you be willing to lend me 3 foods and 2 waters?",391,1
mturk_agent_1,"I see your need for plenty of water and food, but that's just too much to ask. I am making a huge bonfire with my friends, so I do need the firewood. How about 3 firewood and 2 water",391,2
mturk_agent_2,"I could use some firewood as well. How about 2 firewood for you, 1 food and 1 water?",391,2
mturk_agent_1,how about 3 firewood and 1 food for me,391,3
mturk_agent_2,i'm good with that. I really need water to make my baby's bottle. Can I have two waters?,391,3

mturk_agent_2,"What do you have in mind, I could use some things myself",392,0
mturk_agent_1,"We have most basic necessities but could use some more firewood, food and water.",392,1
mturk_agent_2,"We have some of that, but would like to know which you need the most?",392,1
mturk_agent_1,"We are taking our small child camping with us for the first time, and are thinking we would need the most firewood to help keep them warm.   ",392,2
mturk_agent_2,I would be willing to give up a little firewood and some water if you can give me as much food as possible. I vastly underestimated how much food I would need,392,2
mturk_agent_1,I do believe that would be possible.  ,392,3
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks, is there a preference on how much firewood you need?",392,3
mturk_agent_1,"3 packages would be ideal, but I can certainly work with what you are willing to share.  Is there a certain amount of food you need?",392,4
mturk_agent_2,"Same situation as you, please make a trade offer and I will accept if it is fair to both parties",392,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, understand and I can be flexible on the Food but in return I would like 3 Waters. ",393,0
mturk_agent_1,"OK I'm willing to let you have 3 waters, but I would like 2 of the remaining Firewood",393,1
mturk_agent_2,"That does sound reasonable, however I was wondering why you would need the excess fire wood. I dont think I brought enough from the store. ",393,1
mturk_agent_1,"Glad we're aligned! I don't have much either and was hoping to use for a proper fire, which is why I'm interested. ",393,2
mturk_agent_2,"I was also planning to start a proper fire with the wood, however I am not good at starting fire to begin with so I was wondering if I could have the extra",393,2
mturk_agent_1,Would you be willing to give up 1 Water in exchange for getting 2 Firewood total?,393,3
mturk_agent_2,"That does sound reasonable but I really need the water. On the other hand, if you really want the firewood, Ill glad take one food for the excess. ",393,3
mturk_agent_1,Let's just go with you getting 3 water and 2 firewood then. I will take 3 Food and 1 Firewood. Deal?,393,4

mturk_agent_2,"We have extra firewood, it's no fun carrying it around, I'll gladly trade you firewood for food",394,4
mturk_agent_1,That would be awesome! How about I get 3 firewoods and you get 2 food?,394,4
mturk_agent_2,"I think 3 and 3 is fair, but if that does not work for you how does 3 firewoods for 2 foods and 2 waters",394,5
mturk_agent_1,3 and three works for me! And then we gotta decide on the water,394,5

mturk_agent_2,"Im great, how are you?",396,0
mturk_agent_1,I am doing well. I got your information through a collegue of mine at work. I am going camping with my family. Perhaps you may help me with some camping supplies.,396,1
mturk_agent_2,What a coincidence!  I am going camping with my family this weekend as well.  Maybe we could do some trading of supplies.  What is it that you are most in need of?,396,1
mturk_agent_1,That's good to hear. This pandemic has my children craving for the outdoors and so am I.  🙂 I am particular interested in getting extra cases of water. what about you? what's your highest priority?,396,2
mturk_agent_2,Same here 🙂  Getting outdoors and enjoying the open air for a bit will do everyone some good.  We are in need of firewood because we intend to do a lot of cooking out there.  We are doing okay with water so Id be willing to give you 2 cases of water to our 1 if that sounds good.  Id love to get 2 blocks of firewood,396,2
mturk_agent_1,"Let me check with my wife. She is pregnant and water is one of the things she drinks a lot; even though, she is only four months pregnant. But she lost her job due to the pandemic. She is a school teacher. . ",396,3
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, what a time to be teaching right?  Congratulations on the upcoming baby 🙂 Feels like just yesterday my 2 year old and 3 year old were born.  They are hungry little fellas!  Id be willing to give you 3 cases of water if you could spare 3 blocks of firewood.  If you could spare 2 cases of food too my family would be thrilled",396,3
mturk_agent_1,"We checked and my wife and I agree on exchanging with you the first deal; the 2 cases of water for the 2 cases of firewood.  Let me check how we are doing with our food supply. I am glad to hear that  you have young children too, so you know the struggle.",396,4
mturk_agent_2,Absolutely!  They are what makes life worth living but definitely require hard work :)  Thats terrific and id even be willing to give you 3 cases of water to help sell your wife on those 2 cases of food :)  Need to stay hydrated out there! ,396,4
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, we checked our food supply. Sounds like you can get the 2 cases of food. 🙂 I am glad you are willing to gives us the extra water case. Let's do this!!! I am excited. ",396,5

mturk_agent_1,I am eager to go camping! I plan on eating a ton and hope you have food to spare?,397,1
mturk_agent_2,I had only one spare on food,397,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, well I appreciate anything you can spare! Any chance you might have water to share? I could use as much of that as possible too.",397,2
mturk_agent_2,But i need 2 food 2 water and 1 firewood,397,2
mturk_agent_1,"How about I get all of the food, you get all of the water, and then you can have 2 firewood and I will have 1 firewood?",397,3
mturk_agent_2,i need at least one food,397,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about 1 food for you, 2 water for you, and 2 firewood for you?",397,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hi!  I can spare 1 package of water...it's hotter out than I thought, so I need more than anticipated.",398,0
mturk_agent_1,do you have anything you are low on and maybe we can work something out? I really need 2 and would be willing to offer something else,398,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'm running low on food, and could use any extra that you are willing to spare 🙂",398,1
mturk_agent_1,if you can give me 2 water i can offer you 3 food,398,2
mturk_agent_2,Great!  How about firewood?,398,2
mturk_agent_1,i may be able to spare 1 fire wood if you only take 2 food instead of 3,398,3
mturk_agent_2,"Since it's so hot out, I don't need as much firewood.  Food is the bigger priority.",398,3
mturk_agent_1,okay . So you can trade 2 waters for 3 of my food?,398,4
mturk_agent_2,"So you would be getting 2 waters, 0 food, and 3 firewood?",398,4
mturk_agent_1,i would receive 2 water and you would receive 3 food,398,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,398,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,398,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello.  Great to see a fellow camper and hiker.  I'm heer with my wife and mother-in-law.  They are really looking forward to roasting marshmellows this evening after so serious hiking!  How are you doing?  🙂🙂,399,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi!  I am bringing along a huge extended family with me, looking forward to tonight!  Would you mind sharing your highest priority item so that we can try to come up with a fair way to distribute everything?",399,0
mturk_agent_2,Well I can share some food if you have alot of family coming over.  We plan on raosting marshmellows and making s'more each night here in honor of my wife's dad who passed away last year.  That was a big tradition with them and their camp outs. So we really need the firewood and extra water for the hikes which are pretty roughed.,399,1
mturk_agent_1,"Got it, makes sense.  Actually I need food the most since my family will be so hungry!  I would be totally okay with you getting all the extra firewood if I got all the food.  Then we would just need to discuss how to split up water (since my family is going on a hike too, that would be awesome to have too)",399,1
mturk_agent_2,Ok.  Sounds reasonable if I take the 3 firewood and you get 3 food.  We got several big hikes over the weekend and into next week so I would really like 2 waters and 1 for you all.,399,2
mturk_agent_1,"Completely agree on 3 firewood for me and 3 food for you.  Good job figuring that out!  Even though my family is only planning on one hike, it's my whole extended family with me (mother, father, 3 siblings, 5 cousins, 2 aunts, and 2 uncles).  And we forgot to pack iodine pills so we can't purify any river water.  Would you be willing for me to take 2 waters?  Sorry it doesn't distribute exactly evenly ☹️",399,2
mturk_agent_2,"That;s going to be tough on us, we got some long hikes planned and really need to stay hydrate.  Will all of the cousins and family be hiking with you?  ",399,3
mturk_agent_1,"yeah all of them are coming, it's basically our family reunion and we rented out half the campground to have enough room for all of us aha",399,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok.  I can make do with the 3 firewood and 1 water if we make the deal now before my mother-in-law and wife get back.🙂,399,4

mturk_agent_2,"Food is also my highest priority, but firewood is also pretty close for me.",4,1
mturk_agent_1,Would you be willing to take more firewood for less food?,4,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes I think that sounds fair.,4,2
mturk_agent_1,"So if I take 2 foods and 1 firewood, you take 1 food and 2 firewood. What would be fair for water?",4,2
mturk_agent_2,What if I take two waters and you take one water then?,4,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think that sounds fair, since you compromised on food. Sounds like a deal!",4,3

mturk_agent_2,I have a great risk of dehydration.  I really need those 2 extra packages of water. You can have all the extra food.,40,1
mturk_agent_1,Why do you have a risk of dehyrdation? Because I believe all people do but I do understand some people are at a greater risk then others. Tell me why you are at risk?,40,1
mturk_agent_2,"I have a medical condition that requires medication, and this medication requires me to drink an extra amount of water or else I will dehydrate. ",40,2
mturk_agent_1,That is a problem. Does the medication require the use of fire or firewood as well?,40,2
mturk_agent_2,"No, of course not. You can have the extra of those if you'd like. It is really the water that is the most important to me. ",40,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hmmm... I don't really need the firewood,just the food which you are offering and the water. ",40,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, can I have the 2 waters and 2 firewood then? I will give you all of the food, and 1 of the water. Do you need any firewood at all?",40,4
mturk_agent_1,"Since carrying the extra would could make your dehydration worse, I'll take any firewood you don't want. But I'll give you the 2 waters and firewood then for the 3 food and 1 firewood. Deal?",40,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes,thank you for agreeing to the water. I'll give you all the food (3) and 1 firewood and 1 water ",40,5
mturk_agent_1,I couldn't live well with myself if I would let you die. You can have the two waters and 2 firewoods. Please be careful with your meds.,40,5

mturk_agent_1,I also need a lot of food. We're going camping in a desert environment and there's little resources. We're going to have to find a way to split the food and other resources amongst us. ,401,0
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks for letting us know your situation. In this situation, we have to share the available resources between us.Kindly tell what is your highest and lowest priority pckage?",401,1
mturk_agent_1,"Food is my highest priority. I'm less concerned with firewood, as I can find some along the way. How about you/",401,1
mturk_agent_2,i'm also in the same situation. Food is first priority secondly water and the last priority is firewood.,401,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I'm willing to give you 2 food packages if I can have 3 water packages. And then we can figure out firewood. ",401,2
mturk_agent_2,"That's great deal . I accept 2 pack of food 🙂. in this case, I need at least  2 firewood. Then only, we both can meet our requirements.",401,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay that sounds good to me,401,3
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks for the understanding. If you don't mind, can you share only one water. Because, my children need some water.",401,4
mturk_agent_1,If you would like me to share one water then I would like two firewood. I'm in a desert and there's no other water available to me. ,401,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello i was thinking that i could get 3 firwoods? What are your thoughts?,402,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I was thinking you are crazy 🙂.  I would also like firewood as I am naturally a very cold person so I need as much warmth as possible.  I live in the heat and I still use a heavy blanket to stay warm.  My termperature range is very small as I also sweat alot so I'll need lots of water as well.  How about you?",402,0
mturk_agent_2,okay what if you let me get 2 firewoods. I need a little more because where we are going its gets very cold. I will give you 2 waters if i could get 2 firewoods.,402,1
mturk_agent_1,"I think I could survive on 1 firewood, but I would need all the waters and a little extra food.  When I drink water, I always need something extra to go with it.  How does 1 firewood, 3 water, and 1 food for me sound to you?",402,1
mturk_agent_2,okay i can understand that what if i gave you 2 foods and i get at least 1 water?  ,402,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds reasonable - I can take 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 2 food.  That will at least keep me somewhat warm and hydrated.  I'll just have to remember to pack more firewood..",402,2
mturk_agent_2,Great! I just have to make sure i use my water wisely,402,3
mturk_agent_1,Agreed.  I think there's a creek in the area so maybe bring some water purifiers that will make the water potable.  You can also use the firewood to heat up the water.,402,3
mturk_agent_2,"oh yea that a great idea, So you get 1 firewood and i get two and  you get 2 waters and i get 1 and you get 2 foods and i get 1 correct? ",402,4
mturk_agent_1,That's correct - Sounds like we'll both have a fun trip ahead of us.,402,4

mturk_agent_2,"Well I would really prefer the 3 firewood.  I am really worried about getting lyme disease from mosquitos so the fire would keep away the bugs.  Also, this is silly, but I am a little scared of the dark!  So the fire would make me feel better at night.😮",404,1
mturk_agent_1,"You must be all by yourself. Ok, i will give you 2 firewood, you give me 3 food and 2 water. What about that?",404,1
mturk_agent_2,I appreciate your offer of 2 firewood.  Why do you need 3 food?,404,2
mturk_agent_1,I never walk alone🙂 I came along with my other.,404,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh ok so you would want extra food for the other person.  That makes sense.  Would you be willing to take 2 food and 1 water if I get 3 firewood?,404,3
mturk_agent_1,"That will not be fair enough. Lets do this, you take 2 firewood and 1 water.",404,3
mturk_agent_2,"I am happy with the 2 firewood and 1 water, but would then prefer 2 food also if that if ok.",404,4
mturk_agent_1,"Come on, i am the one to get the 2 food and 2 water!",404,4

mturk_agent_2,Are you interested in extra firewood at all? Making s'mores is super fun!🙂,405,1
mturk_agent_1,"I am interested in the wood. With a family of 6, I can imagine you would like extra too. I only have 4...",405,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would love to have the three extra foods, one of the waters and one of the firewood. That would give you two extra water and two firewoods. Would you be interested in that?",405,2
mturk_agent_1,"Can I have 3 waters, 0 food and 1 firewood?",405,3
mturk_agent_2,That might work out. We have dogs too but we aren't bringing them with us. We have friends that will be watching them. I guess I could just make sure to bring extra with me. 🙂,405,3

Is there a possibility we can negotiate the amount of food? I am willing to decrease the amount of firewood and water but am stuck on having 2 or more food items for my family.",406,1
mturk_agent_2,Seeing as my boys do love campfire and having smores I can definitely work it out with you. 🙂,406,2
mturk_agent_1,"If I take 2 food, 1 firewood, and 1 water, would that work for you?",406,2

mturk_agent_1,Hello! I have no issue with you taking a lot of the firewood - I likely wouldn't be outside much at night anyway. ,409,0
mturk_agent_2,🙂 Cool thank you! What can I help you with? ,409,1
mturk_agent_1,"I feel like I'd need the food the most. I plan on being very active throughout the trip, and if I'm not able to eat well, this wouldn't be possible.",409,1
mturk_agent_2,Okay. I can definitely spare you some of the food! Do you need any water?,409,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, water is important too... but I think it's a little less important than food for me. ",409,2
mturk_agent_2,Same with me. We can split the water. ,409,3
mturk_agent_1,"I like that! If you took all the firewood, could I have two of the waters?",409,3

mturk_agent_1,"Sry for the extra emoticons, laptop's glitching apparently. Well, what can you give me or we come to a deal on? 🙂",41,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, let me think on that.  Why do you need so much water for a starter?",41,2
mturk_agent_1,I get dehydrated easily. I need to water so that doesn't happen. 🙂,41,3
mturk_agent_2,Hmm.  And why do you need so much food?,41,3
mturk_agent_1,"I need an extra supply of food, as I exercise a lot! 🙂",41,4
mturk_agent_2,Hmmm.  And the firewood?,41,4
mturk_agent_1,I get cold easily. I need the firewood to get warm. I might catch a cold.🙂,41,5
mturk_agent_2,I think water should be your priority.  You have food and firewood also in your basics.  I will let you have the 3 water but I will need the 3 Firewood and the 3 Food.  I have a medical condition.,41,5
mturk_agent_1,Okay that works well. I accept! 🙂,41,6

mturk_agent_1,"I can do 2 packages of firewood, 1 package of water, and 1 package of food. 🙂",410,1
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks for that offer.  (I actually meant to say 3 packages of food, not firewood. That was a typo, sorry.)  I do really need more food because I get light headed if I go too long without eating. I just don't think I would enjoy myself if I didn't have enough food.  Would you consider 3 packages of food?",410,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can consider 2 packages of food, but I can't go any higher than that.",410,2
mturk_agent_2,I appreciate that. 🙂.  I'm also concerned about the water.  I'm afraid I might get dehydrated since I don't have quite enough water at the moment.  I'd like to ask you for 2 packages.🙂,410,2
mturk_agent_1,"Unfortunately, I cannot do 2 package as I desperately need it for my own survival. I have to stand my ground on 1 package.",410,3
mturk_agent_2,"I understand, thanks.  How are you on firewood? I hear it gets cold here at night.  Can you spare 1 package?",410,3
mturk_agent_1,I can give you 2 packages of my firewood. I don't need too much of it where I am.,410,4
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, that's great!  I'm looking forward to the cozy nights.  Can we get back to the food packages again though?  I know how I get when I don't have enough food available and I'm really light on food.  If I get light headed, I will feel awful and the camping trip will just be ruined.  Is 2 packages the absolute best you can do? I would really appreciate it if you would reconsider. 🙂🙂",410,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I need to keep one package of food for myself, I'm so sorry. I can't budge on that. So where I'm standing right now, it's 2 packages of food, 2 packages of firewood, and 1 package of water.",410,5

mturk_agent_1,"Awesome, Ill take all foods, and youll take all firewood, and for water, do you want one or 2? The deal button will open after we converse for a total of 10 messages, but prior to that we have to agree on the amount of packages we agree each will get. 🙂",413,3

mturk_agent_2,"Are you sure you won't get hungry? I am open to giving you the two waters, but I want to make sure its the best deal for you. I would want 2 firewoods and 2 foods in exchange.",415,2
mturk_agent_1,"brother  k ,  bro  2 water and 2 wire wood 1 firewood can you given?",415,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think that that is acceptable to me. I want to make sure we both understand: I get 1 Water, 2 Firewood, 2 Food Packages. You get 2 Waters, 1 Firewood, 1 Food Package. I will have to ration my water, but I think the extra comfort is worth it. Does this work for you? ",415,3
mturk_agent_1,"bro its not profitable ratiobro gave 3 water 1 firewood, remaning you can take",415,3
mturk_agent_2,Won't you feel hungry? I'll accept that deal if we can exchange one water for one food package. That still leaves you with two waters. I think that's the least I'm willing to accept.,415,4

mturk_agent_1,No I need more firewood,417,0
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, can I ask why the firewood is important for you? 🙂",417,1
mturk_agent_1,You can find more wood in the forest but I'm going somewhere where there's not a loot of trees ☹️,417,1
mturk_agent_2,That makes sense. What if you took 2 firewood in exchange for 1 additional food?,417,2
mturk_agent_1,you can have 3 food,417,2
mturk_agent_2,"Alright🙂 From what I understand, that means that you would take 3 firewood, and I would take 3 water and 3 food. Is this your understanding as well?",417,3
mturk_agent_1,Can we split the water? You can have 2,417,3
mturk_agent_2,"I would prefer to have all 3 water, but I think I can make an exception since you have offered me all 3 food 🙂 Just to confirm, this means that you get 3 firewood and 1 water and I get 2 water and 3 food. Correct?",417,4

mturk_agent_1,"I am looking for food, me and the kiddos need to eat many snacks for energy while exploring hiking trails. What about?",418,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, that makes sense. I really need water. I am willing to trade you all 3 of the food if you will give me all of the water. What do you think?",418,2
mturk_agent_1,I think that sounds okay but I need at least one water please?,418,2
mturk_agent_2,If you want one water you can only have 2 foods. Do you really need the water? It sounds like food is a much more important item to you🙂,418,3
mturk_agent_1,Ok I will take 3 food and 3 firewood and you can all 3 water? 🙂,418,3
mturk_agent_2,No. I will need 1 firewood to agree to this deal. Otherwise it seems a bit unfair to me.,418,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hello! camper, how are you? I need us to make a deal where we all benefit.",419,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I expect that! You need food most and I need water, so let's propose an exact trade? 3 for 3?",419,1
mturk_agent_1,"My main objective for the camp is food and firewood, since I have a large family and the amount of food they give in the camp is very small for all my family and my wife and I have to cook with firewood in the camp.",419,2
mturk_agent_2,"I understand completely. I would like to have all three water, and I'm only traveling with just me, so how about 1 firewood? The rest for you.",419,2
mturk_agent_1,"No me gusta mucho el trato, pero para eso debemos hablar y decidir como adultos un buen trato para los dos. Lo que queremos es disfrutar en el campamento.",419,3
mturk_agent_2,I do not understand spanish. Please speak to me in English.,419,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry I'm practicing my Spanish for the camp. I do not like the deal very much, but for that we must talk and decide as adults a good deal for both of us. What we want is to enjoy in the camp.",419,4

mturk_agent_2,I'm great! Me too! did you have any specific plans? I wanted to make an extra fire to cook with and cook a nice meal. ,42,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes. I'm actually taking a large group of people. Some friends and family are going and I kind of also wanted a bit of extra firewood. 🙂,42,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh I get that! I wanted to make a nice meal for my friends so I was hoping to be able to get extra food. 🙂,42,2
mturk_agent_1,Oh well that's no problem. I'm packing a lot for our group. I'd be willing to give you all the food if you give me all the firewood?,42,2
mturk_agent_2,I would be willing to do that if I could have two of the waters? I didn't bring as much as I thought I would need because I forgot I would have my dog. ,42,3
mturk_agent_1,"I can do that. So we're doing three firewood, one water and zero food for me and zero firewood, two water and three food for you?",42,3

mturk_agent_2,"I can't wait 🙂 Let's talk about these supplies. I've got hungry mouths to feed, Can I take the food and you can have half the firewood and all the water?",420,1
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, I need food too. I am willing to split. I will give you 2 food since you claimed it first. Can I have 2 waters then?",420,2
mturk_agent_2,"That's fair, but I have wiggle room on the water, how about I take two food, two firewood and you take 3 water, 1 food, 1 firewood?",420,2
mturk_agent_1,"Is there anyway you will go with that I get two firewood? I need food the most but since you get most of that can I get most of the firewood? So 1 food, 2 firewood, and 2 water for me?",420,3
mturk_agent_2,You drive a hard bargain. I could really use that firewood. It's going to get cold tonight and these sleeping bags are not worth the price I paid ;),420,3
mturk_agent_1,"Haha, I know but I am in the same situation! ☹️ and since I am getting less food I feel like it is fair I get on more firewood since I truly need that 🙂",420,4

mturk_agent_2,"I am giving you all the water,  how come you need the food? ",421,3
mturk_agent_1,"The main reason is to prevent us from cold.  Please provide three wood and three water.  If this is okay, then I will provide you three food.",421,3
mturk_agent_2,Food doesn't prevent cold. Thank you for giving me all the food but I need 1 wood to cook the additional food. You still end up with more items in the  end  ,421,4

",423,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I am great 🙂 How are you? I would be happy for you to have two waters if I can have one. I would also like to have three things of food. I love cooking outside, so I would love to make large delicious meals for my group to enjoy",423,0

mturk_agent_2,"I completely understand, thank you for compromising with water and food. Wished we had 4 firewoods to divide and share it equaly, may I ask how long will you be camping for? Im afraid I need 2 firewoods as well, maybe we can see who has the greater need? ",423,2
mturk_agent_1,"I am going to be camping for a couple of weeks, so I will need quite a bit. I also realized some additional water would be good, because I have some meals that need me to boil water. Maybe you can have 2 firewood in exchange for me having one of your waters? Then you would still have plenty of water, but also plenty of firewood 🙂",423,2
mturk_agent_2,"So sorry, I just realized you did not agree to the 3 waters in exchange of 3 foods. if you want a water, i will also will need one food. just to make things more fair on my end. If not i am looking at 2 waters, 0 foods, and 1 firewood. But i am willing to compromise for 3 waters, 1 firewood, and 0 foods. and you'll get 3 foods, 2 firewoods, and 0 waters, what do you think?",423,3
mturk_agent_1," I appreciate your willingness to discuss this, so we both get a fair deal. I would really like if I get 3 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood. Then you would get 2 water and 2 firewood. You said that you really need water and food, so I think that would work best for both of us to get what we need most. What do you think? 🙂",423,3
mturk_agent_2,"Np, problem, water is high in demand on my end with the amount of kiddos I am taking. Water is my main concern, will you be okay with 3 Foods, 2 Firewoods and no water?",423,4
mturk_agent_1,"I would really like 3 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood if possible. Would you agree to that instead?",423,4
mturk_agent_2,"If you were me would you be happy with 0 Foods, 2 waters, and 2 Firewoods? when water is your priority? maybe we can make it even, your highest priority is Food and mine is water? you can have all firewood? I will be shorten out on everything except the water and youll get 3 foods and 3 firewoods, while i only get 3 waters?",423,5
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I will agree to me getting 3 food and 3 firewood. Thank you for discussing this with me! 🙂",423,5

mturk_agent_1,Tell me why you need so much firewood?,424,5
mturk_agent_2,I have other people coming with me and we don't have insulated sleeping bags.  The temperature also drops drastically at night.,424,6

mturk_agent_1,Hi! How are you today?,425,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm doing well! How are you?,425,0
mturk_agent_1,I am doing quite well myself. Why are you camping today?,425,1
mturk_agent_2,Well my sister and her husband are celebrating their anniversary this weekend so we volunteered to watch her daughters. We decided it would be fun to take her kids and ours camping! What about you? 🙂,425,1
mturk_agent_1,That is really nice of you! I hope they have fun! My family had this trip planned for quite awhile. We have an extra person with us because my son begged me for his friend to come. I couldn't say no. 🙂,425,2
mturk_agent_2,I have definitely been there before! With taking all the kids I'm worried about them getting dehydrated. I also have a 7 month old that needs water to make her bottles! I was hoping to get 3 extra packaged of water for sure. ,425,2
mturk_agent_1,That is one of my fears as well. Does you seven month old breast feed? I am hoping for the water as well. I would love to give them to you if I had extra. Is there anything else you need?,425,3
mturk_agent_2,"No they don't ☹️ She is starting to eat a few solid food items. So if I had some extra food that would help. I think if I had 2 waters, 2 food, and 1 firewood to be able to cook and keep things clean I would have enough. ",425,3
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you 2 waters, but I would need all the food because my group is bigger. You can have two firewood.",425,4
mturk_agent_2,I would need at least 1 food. ,425,4
mturk_agent_1,"I could give you one food, but I would need to have 2 waters to make my food last by making soup.",425,5
mturk_agent_2,How about I get 2 waters and 3 firewood?,425,5
mturk_agent_1,"I think I can give you two waters, and 2 firewood.",425,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,425,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,425,7
mturk_agent_2,HI. I'd love to get 2 additional packs of firewood. The weather forecast was for much warmer weather here and I just didn't bring enough with me. I also left my additional sweatshirt at home. I'd be happy to give you one additional water and two of food.  🙂🙂,426,0
mturk_agent_1,Well I had a really great day fishing today and I would like to have some extra firewood so I can cook all of this fish.  How about I take the 3 packages of firewood and you can keep 2 additional food packages in return.,426,0
mturk_agent_2,You really did have a good day didn't you! Sounds like fun. How many fish can one person eat? If I don't have the extra firewood I'm going to be really cold tonight. ☹️,426,1
mturk_agent_1,I am here with my family and we love to eat fish.🙂  Maybe if you spend tonight sleeping in your car or camper I can keep the fire wood. In exchange I will give you the 2 additional food packages and all 3 of the water packages. It's only for 1 night.,426,1
mturk_agent_2,Why would you want to give up all that water? You're going to need extra water for your family to drink. All the sodium in the fish is going to make you all thirsty!,426,2
mturk_agent_1,"Your right,😮  I didn't think about that. But will probably only need 1 extra package of water so, in exchange I will offer you 1 package of firewood.",426,2
mturk_agent_2,"I know this isn't your problem, but I'm a student and I had to come up here to take photos of the night sky for my astronomy class. I slept really late today as I have to sit up all night to get the different stars, and possibly even the space station if it's clear enough out. I have to sit by a fire to stay warm so I can get these pictures to hand in to my professor tomorrow.",426,3
mturk_agent_1,You know that is very impressive.  I admire your determination and effort you put into your class.  You must be very passionate about astronomy.,426,3
mturk_agent_2,"I am. My favorite personality is Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He's amazing, funny and incredibly smart. I'm hoping to get an internship at the Planetarium in my senior year 🙂",426,4
mturk_agent_1,That's amazing!!!  So here is the deal...I'll give you the 2 firewood packages so you can sleep under the stars tonight.  In return I'll have to keep 2 water packages and 2 food packages since I won't be able to cook all of this fish and I still have a family to feed.  ,426,4
mturk_agent_2,I'm glad you understand my problem. But I really need those 3 firewood packages. I'd be happy to give you 2 water packages and all the food in exchange.,426,5
mturk_agent_1,Initially you were willing to take the 2 packages of firewood. If you have all three I won't be able to cook any of this fish and it will all go to waste. ☹️,426,5
mturk_agent_2,Didn't you bring any firewood at all with you?,426,6
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, but the firewood I have will be used to keep us warm tonight.  Like you mentioned before it will be a bit chilly tonight.",426,6
mturk_agent_2,"Ahh, I forgot about that. OK. I'll take 2 packages of firewood, give you 2 waters, and 1 food packages as you do have some fish to cook and I don't. Do we have a deal?",426,7

mturk_agent_1,Yeah I'm hoping to relax with my family and enjoy the outdoors ,427,2
mturk_agent_2,"Same, i do ask though as i have a medical condition if i can have all the water, it is really hard for me to stay hydrated",427,2
mturk_agent_1,oh that is tough. I am also looking for water. I need it to cook our food and it is going to be extra hot and I need to keep my family hydrated,427,3
mturk_agent_2,May i atleast have 2? I can get siezures if i dont get enough hydration,427,3
mturk_agent_1,would you trade 2 water for 3 firewood and 1 food?,427,4

mturk_agent_2,Yes! Hope for lot of fun. Is there any special deal can you offer for maximum order.,428,1
mturk_agent_1,What item are you looking for the most of?  ,428,1
mturk_agent_2,Water and food is on high need than the firewood. Expect for the best combo for food and water.,428,2
mturk_agent_1,I brought plenty of water.  I think I could give you all 3 water. Food is what I need the most of so wonder if I took 2 packages of food and left you 1?,428,2
mturk_agent_2,It's better to give 2 packages on both ,428,3
mturk_agent_1,2 packages of both of what?  Water and food?,428,3
mturk_agent_2,I mean water and food,428,4
mturk_agent_1,Is food something you need the most of or is it water?,428,4
mturk_agent_2,I need 2 packages of both food and water on each,428,5
mturk_agent_1,Food is a hard one to give 2 packes of since I dont have very much and need to feed my family.  We do have plenty of water though.  Would you be willing to take 3 packages of water and only get 1 package of food?,428,5
mturk_agent_2,Is any other item is left with you to add ,428,6
mturk_agent_1,"I would be willing to give you 3 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood which we be 5 packages for you.  I would take 2 food and 2 firewood which would be 4 packages for me",428,6

mturk_agent_2,"Good afternoon. Ok, water is a medium need for me. I have some to get by. I really need firewood. It's cold.",429,0
mturk_agent_1,I'd be willing to give up all the firewood in exchange for the water. I also am low on Food and would need at least 2.,429,1
mturk_agent_2,That doesn't sound like something I can agree to. Do you have any other ideas?,429,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can keep 2 of the firewood then and offer you 2 of the food. I'd take the water, 2 firewood and 1 water",429,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would do 3 firewood, 2 water and 2 food.",429,2
mturk_agent_1,"I can't do that. Truth is I need the firewood and I was hoping you didn't need it. I propose I keep 1 firewood, 3 waters and 2 food and you take the rest?",429,3
mturk_agent_2,"I would do this instead: 3 firewood, 1 water and 2 food.",429,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's not going to be a fair offer, you'll need to do better than that or I don't think we can come to an agreement",429,4
mturk_agent_2,"3 firewood, 1 water, 0 food",429,4
mturk_agent_1,"so I'll get 2 water, 3 food and 0 firewood?",429,5
mturk_agent_2,Incorrect. ,429,5
mturk_agent_1,In order to make it work I need at least 3 water and 2 food. Or I could do 3 firewood and 2 food and 0 water. I don't see any other way around it,429,6
mturk_agent_2,It has to be fair. Right now I don't think you are being fair. The last offer I gave was great for you. You all all of the food and 2 water.You wanted 3 food in your last offer so thats a great offer I suggested.,429,6
mturk_agent_1,I will agree to 2 water and 3 food for me and the rest for you.,429,7

mturk_agent_2,"I love camping also!  Yes, I can see how you would need firewood if you want to cook your food.  So, food is more important to you than water?",43,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I will need a little water to wash that food down with though. Are you going to be needing a lot of water?",43,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I may need more water.  I am on a diet and I don't really cook either!  Hopefully we can work something out here.",43,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds great. I probably need to go on a diet, but I like my food to much. LOL",43,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I am pre-diabetic, so I had to do it for my health. I love food, too...especially sugar!  🙂🙂",43,3
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, that does change things a lot. Diabetes is a hard disease to have to deal with. So you want more firewood than water? And less food than water?",43,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I don't know.  I think I would like more water than firewood, but yes less food than water.  I'm a pretty easy going person though! 🙂",43,4

mturk_agent_1,No in the end i will only be getting 3 items where you get 6 i think my way is more fair,434,3
mturk_agent_2,Yeah but my 6 aren't worth all that much. I'm the one who will have to answer to my family for not getting enough firewood. 🙂,434,4

mturk_agent_1,I am actually very much in need of water. I fell while I was hiking during this trip. I have a really bad wound I need to clean on my leg. ,437,1
mturk_agent_2,yikes that stinks. i got some extra people with me and we dont hve enough either. could i take 2 since we will be drinking it and maybe you can have 1 to get that wound cleaned up,437,1
mturk_agent_1,There is a lot of blood on my wound and if I don't get it cleaned I am afraid I would have to have it amputated. It's likely I'll be stationary a long time. Maybe I can give you 2 water in exchange for 2 foods since I'll be stuck up here for a long time? ,437,2
mturk_agent_2,oh no!!!!! sounds like you shouldnt be camping at all. thats insane that happened. youre definitely in my thoughts. uhm i guess i have no choice since your situation is dire. so to be clear youre saying i can have two water and you can have two wood? if so thats ok with me,437,2
mturk_agent_1,I would give you 2 water in exchange for 2 of your food supplies,437,3
mturk_agent_2,im sorry i mistyped. okay yes thats a deal. so last we have to talk about the wood. what do you think,437,3
mturk_agent_1,"Oh yes, sorry I am so caught up with my wound I completely forgot about that. I can spare 1 firewood so you would get 2, do you think you could spare another water in exchange for the wood?",437,4
mturk_agent_2,i cant unfortunately i really need the two water im sorry. ,437,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,437,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,437,5
mturk_agent_2,im so sorrry unfortunately i am in dire need of two wood we are in a very cold climate,437,6
mturk_agent_1,"how about i get 1 water, 2 food, and 2 firewood since I'll be here so long? because of my leg i likely won't be able to leave anytime soon",437,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,437,7
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,437,7
mturk_agent_1,What about I give you more food in exchange for you giving me more water? I could give you 2 food and you give me an extra water?,437,8
mturk_agent_2,unfortunately that doesnt work for me. i am afraid i will not be able to discuss this any further my final offer is i get 2water 2food and 1wood,437,8
mturk_agent_1,can we meet in the middle? if we cannot come to an agreement we both get nothing and we both lose. i am in dire need of the water to keep my leg from having to be amputated. i have children at home i take care of and i can't live without my leg,437,9

mturk_agent_1,Hi there fellow camper!,438,0
mturk_agent_2,Howdy 🙂 How are things?,438,0
mturk_agent_1,I can't complain since I have a fun trip coming up! How about you?,438,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm pretty decent.  I just had a bit of a problem with my blood sugar level but otherwise I'm doing fine.,438,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh no! I hope you are okay! ,438,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, I'm okay now.  It's just that I need to have a lot of food around to be able to manage it properly.  Like on this camping trip.",438,2
mturk_agent_1,"I totally understand! I am in need of food too, but it sounds like you really need it so I am hapy to give you all of the food if I can have all of the firewood?",438,3
mturk_agent_2,"What is your need for water?  I could use some of that, too.",438,3
mturk_agent_1,I am pretty desperate for water! I tend to get thrisy when camping. Can I have 2 of the water?,438,4
mturk_agent_2,"I could live with that but I'd need to get one firewood.  I don't feel comfortable going with so little water but then also not having any firewood, since that's potentially useful for both food and water.",438,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,438,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,438,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,438,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,438,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello! Do you have any sort of preference regarding the 3 camping items?,439,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello there! It's nice to meet you. Truthfully, I need to get some food and some firewood. What do you need?",439,0
mturk_agent_1,"The main thing I like to do when camping is a lot of hiking (pretty much all day), so I was hoping to get as much food as possible so I can remain active.",439,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm sure we can come up with a compromise! I understand the need for extra food with exercise. Sometimes I get low blood sugar and need an extra snack. I'll give you 2 food if I can get 1.,439,1
mturk_agent_1,I think that is a totally fair split for the food. And I actually don't need a lot of firewood. I would be willing to give you all of it in exchange for the water.,439,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think so, too. I'm glad you offered that - we got stuck in the rain and need the firewood to dry our clothes. I'd be more than happy to give you all the water for all the firewood.",439,2
mturk_agent_1,"Great! I get dehydrated very easily, so I am pretty jumpy at the thought of running out! 🙂",439,3
mturk_agent_2,"That's not good! ☹️ We don't want that to happen. So to confirm, you get 2 food and all the water, and I get 1 food and all the firewood? 🙂",439,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes. I would get 2 food and 3 water, and you would get 1 food and 3 firewood. Hopefully this works for you!",439,4
mturk_agent_2,You have yourself a deal!,439,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,439,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,439,5

mturk_agent_2,What did you expect from me? Because same position is here also,44,1
mturk_agent_1,I would like to share water with you as we already have it in some quantity,44,2
mturk_agent_2,I am ready to give 1 amount of food for you. But I want some quantity of water and firewood for me.,44,2
mturk_agent_1,I would take 3 packages of food and just 1 package of water. Is it okay for you?,44,3
mturk_agent_2,"No, I don't take this. Because food is important for my child and me.",44,3
mturk_agent_1,Try to understand our situation. We had food a week back. We were drinking only water for the whole week. We are dying of hunger. Kindly understand our situation.,44,4
mturk_agent_2,"Even me too facing the same, but i am ready to share one food with you. You can offer me more water to safe myself without dying. Both will be happy",44,4
mturk_agent_1,Okay I shall give you 1 package of food and 2 packages of water. Is that okay for you now?,44,5

mturk_agent_1,food is necessary for all living beings. ,443,0
mturk_agent_2,I am traveling with a big group so we need more water.,443,0
mturk_agent_1,lots of water only for when u have thirsty,443,1
mturk_agent_2,That's true but we don't want to be dehydrated either since we have so many people haha. Here's my suggestion: 2 waters for me and 2 food items for you?,443,1
mturk_agent_1,if u had hungry means what will u do. u need food. right. hehehe,443,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm willing to give more food to you in exchange for more water since not everybody in my group eats a lot. How about this: I take 2 waters, 1 food, 1 firewood and you can get everything else?",443,2
mturk_agent_1,ok i accept  ur thoughts.sharing is good habit,443,3
mturk_agent_2,Perfect 🙂 I think that sounds like a good deal for both of us!,443,3
mturk_agent_1,yes i deal with u,443,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok so when we can submit, this will be the breakdown: ",443,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,443,5

mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,443,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,443,7
mturk_agent_1,Hello,444,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there.. how are you doing today?  I hope well!  🙂  So, it looks like we need to divy up these supplies, huh?  Do you have any thoughts on the issue?",444,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm doing fine thank you, how about you? Well for my trip I'm most interesting in socializing so a great campfire a night would be great, I'd prefer not to boil water either so want extra of that too. Food less so as I will go fishing and know wild vegetables, fruits and mushrooms I can pick. How about you?",444,1
mturk_agent_2,Awesome.. it seems like we're kind of on the same page here then as I'm going to need food for my people since they're not real self-sufficient but I'm less neurotic about the water or the firewood.. we're from Florida so we actually kind of like the cooler weather anyway.. lol,444,1
mturk_agent_1,Seems like we can come to good terms here. How much of the 3 food packages do you want?,444,2
mturk_agent_2,"So, I'd love to take 2 of the food, 1 of the water, and one of the firewood.. that would leave you 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood.. so technically, you're actually netting a higher item count 🙂",444,2
mturk_agent_1,That is a very fair deal. Sure you could join us at our campfire if you wanted some heat.,444,3
mturk_agent_2,That would be awesome.. I'm looking forward to it.  Glad we could come up to such an amicable and easy arrangement 🙂,444,3
mturk_agent_1,"Indeed, glad we could agree without any fuss. Sure I could catch you some fish too 🙂",444,4
mturk_agent_2,"Rock on.. we love fish.. well at least I do 🙂  Not sure about everyone else.. but if not, oh well, more fish for me 🙂",444,4
mturk_agent_1,Well if they don't like fish more for us :) So we are 100% agreed now?,444,5
mturk_agent_2,Yes.. absolutely.. I'll put the deal together now 🙂,444,5
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you, been great chatting to you. Lets enjoy the trip!",444,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,444,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,444,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! camper, how are you? I need us to make a deal where we all benefit.I'm so excited for our camping trip.  I'm most excited about getting to eat food that I normally don't when I am home.🙂",445,0
mturk_agent_1,I am excited too and looking forward to making a deal that works well for both of us!,445,0
mturk_agent_2,"My main objective for the camp is water, since I have a large family and the amount of water they give in the camp is very small for all my family.",445,1
mturk_agent_1,I need water also but firewood is my second highest priority item. Maybe you could take more of the water and I could take more of the firewood.,445,1
mturk_agent_2,"I find it a good deal, however before making a deal, I like to talk to people, get to know them better. I plan to go to camp with my family: my wife, my four children and myself. Are you going with your family?",445,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I am going with my wife and two teenage sons. We are planning on doing a lot of fishing!",445,2
mturk_agent_2,What do you think if in the camp we get together and have a meeting between your family and mine? We can have a small party to get to know each other better.,445,3
mturk_agent_1,Sounds great!,445,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, my proposal is to give you all the firewood you need, on the condition that you give me all the water I need. And regarding food we can negotiate.",445,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good. What do you propose on the food?,445,4
mturk_agent_2,"My proposal is to give you 3 firewood, 2 food and 0 water. What do you think of the deal?",445,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,445,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,445,6
mturk_agent_1,Hey how's it going,446,0
mturk_agent_2,"Good, looking forward to my camping trip.",446,0
mturk_agent_1,"Nice, I am too. I'm actually looking to gather up some extra supplies, what about you?",446,1
mturk_agent_2,"I need extra supplies as well. I'll be camping at a higher elevation and need extra firewood for warmth, extra food and some water. What do you need?",446,1
mturk_agent_1,"I was really looking for extra food, firewood is important to me but I could spare some in exchange. I normally eat more than the average person so I'm worried my food supplies as is will make it hard to get through the trip.",446,2
mturk_agent_2,I would like a little extra food for myself as well. Would you be willing to split the food 1 for me and 2 for you? ,446,2
mturk_agent_1,I'd be willing to do that if you gave me some water and firewood in exchange,446,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about I keep 2 firewood, you take 1? What do you propose for the water?",446,3
mturk_agent_1,1 food for 1 firewood isn't a good trade for me. I would need at least 1 firewood and 1 water to trade for 1 food.,446,4
mturk_agent_2,"Here is my proposal. I will take 2 firewood, 1 food and 1 water.  You can take 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood.",446,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me!,446,5
mturk_agent_2,"ok, so to make sure we're on the same page. You get 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood. I will take 1 food, 1 water, and 2 firewood?",446,5
mturk_agent_1,"Yup, I am ready to submit the deal if it's all good with you!",446,6
mturk_agent_2,"Yes sir! (or ma'am), I accept the deal!",446,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,446,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,446,7
mturk_agent_1,Hello.  What are your preferences for extra items for your camping trip?,447,0
mturk_agent_2,hello,447,0
mturk_agent_1,Do you have a preference for any extra items for your camping trip?,447,1
mturk_agent_2,"yes. i need 2 pack of firewood, 2 pack of water and 1 pack of food",447,1
mturk_agent_1,"I need 3 packs of firewood, 2 packs of food and 3 packs of water.  My husband and I are diabetic, so we're cold-natured, need regular meals and hydration.",447,2
mturk_agent_2,but i don't have back up for firewood. i need at least 2 pack of firewood. then only it will be better for me,447,2
mturk_agent_1,"If I can have the 3 packs of food and 3 packs of water, then you can have 2 packs of firewood.",447,3
mturk_agent_2,oh god. without food and water how can i survive in the camping trip?,447,3
mturk_agent_1,"This is true. Although we're negotiating for extra provisions.  I understand your situation, though.  I can use 1 pack of firewood, 2 pack of water and just 1 pack of food.",447,4
mturk_agent_2,okay fine. now it is suitable for both of us,447,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good.  Thank you for being fair and agreeable.  ,447,5
mturk_agent_2,thank you for your time,447,5
mturk_agent_1,Thank you as well. 🙂,447,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,447,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,447,7
mturk_agent_1,I am thinking I will want food most,448,0
mturk_agent_2,Great! Food is not my priority but water and food is.,448,0
mturk_agent_1,"awesome, you can have 3 water and i'll take 3 food?",448,1
mturk_agent_2,🙂 I am fine with it. How about the firewood?,448,1
mturk_agent_1,"i'll take 2, you can have 1? ",448,2
mturk_agent_2,Firewood is my second priority. Can I have 2 of firewood?,448,2
mturk_agent_1,okay🙂 is it cold so you want firewood?,448,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I get cold easy. Thanks a lot!",448,3
mturk_agent_1,"sure, i have a lot of people coming thats why i need food",448,4
mturk_agent_2,"No problems with that. I am glad we could make a deal. To summarize, you will have 3 of food and 1 of firewood while I will have 3 of water and 2 of Firewood.",448,4
mturk_agent_1,yes🙂,448,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,448,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,448,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, how are you today?",449,0
mturk_agent_1,Fine thank you. How about you?,449,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am great, i am really excited about camping how about you?",449,1
mturk_agent_1,Same here! Its my family's first time out together and we are at the camping already.,449,1
mturk_agent_2,"Nice, are there any extra supplies that you will really need?",449,2
mturk_agent_1,"At the camping site. Yes, I would like some water and food to refill the used packs",449,2
mturk_agent_2,"I was hoping to get alot of water as well, would you be ok with me getting two waters and three firewoods if you get all the food and one water?",449,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, that's not favorable for me going by the volume of items left in my arsenal. Water is more of a higher priority than food. So, I would exchange 1 pack of food for an additional water",449,3
mturk_agent_2,So that way you would get two waters and two foods? Those are my priorities as well but i would be ok with it since that way i would get five items and you would get only four.,449,4
mturk_agent_1,"Those are your priorities?? Then that's not fair for you. Then I take 2 water, 1 firewood and 1 food. This is the lowest I can offer",449,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,449,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,449,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello! How are you today?,45,0
mturk_agent_2,Good how are you,45,0
mturk_agent_1,I am doing quite good. I enjoy camping. I however did not bring enough food.,45,1
mturk_agent_2,Ok I'm sure we can work it out because I know I need extra water and firewood. Do you have any ideas on how to divvy up the extra supplies?,45,1
mturk_agent_1,"I would need some firewood as well, as I need it to cook the food. I was thinking maybe you can have all the water and I have all the food.",45,2
mturk_agent_2,"All the food is too much, I would need at least one package of the food for my group. I was thinking you could have 2 of the food packages and I have 1, then I get all the water and the majority of the firewood. That leaves you with 2 of the high priority food packages and a package of firewood to cook the food.",45,2
mturk_agent_1,That seems quite unfair. I really would like my camping trip to be enjoyable.,45,3
mturk_agent_2,I understand. What part of the deal is unfair to you? You get the majority of the highest priority item (food) and I get the majority of the lower priority items (water and firewood).,45,3
mturk_agent_1,I will have my two packages of food and only one package of firewood. I do not think I can make one package of firewood last for both of my food. ,45,4
mturk_agent_2,"So is your counter that you get 2 packages of food, 0 of water, and 2 of firewood?",45,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I would be happy with two food and two firewood. That would leave you with one food and one firewood as well as all of the water.",45,5
mturk_agent_2,Ok that sounds fair I agree to that 🙂,45,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,45,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,45,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi  - nice to meet you!  I hope we can work out a deal that is good for both of us.,450,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, 🙂 It's nice to meet you as well: I also hope we can work something out: Food is my excess trip priority, What is yours?",450,0
mturk_agent_1,Mine is firewood with second being food.,450,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm definitely willing to give up some food for some firewood: That seems like a place where we can come to an arrangement: Would you like to make an opening offer? ,450,1
mturk_agent_1,Sure!  I figure I can go with little water as we can get it from the stream and boil it.  So for water I would be willing to give you 2 packages.  Would that be fair?,450,2
mturk_agent_2,"so If I understand correctly, the Deal is I get 3 Food and 2 Water: While you get 3 Firewood and 1 Water?",450,2
mturk_agent_1,I was just negotiating the water for now.  I was trying to do one at a time.,450,3
mturk_agent_2,"ah, I'm definitely ok with doing one at a time: A 2:1 split is definitely OK with me: The issue is, if we consider each individually, it might be harder to come to a deal, but I'm happy to do it your way.",450,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about you take 1 firewood, I''l take 2 and with food, you can have 2 and I'll take one package.  I have two very hungry boys!",450,4
mturk_agent_2,Is there a reason you want the 2:1 split? Food my group's largest priority by a large margin (We eat a lot). It's worth a lot more to my group then the firewood would be.,450,4
mturk_agent_1,That's why I would like to give you 2 and I will take 1 food.  I have 8 and 10 year old boys.🙂,450,5
mturk_agent_2,"I'm interested in hearing more about why you want a 2/1 split: Is the food worth more to you than the third firewood? If so, I'm happy to do that split, but I'd like 3 water in return.",450,5

mturk_agent_1,"Hi, nice getting to interact with you. It is fine if I give one of it, as that is something that I need the most as well.",452,0
mturk_agent_2,I can give you 2 packages of food or firewood instead,452,1
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm. I'm not able to compromise on this, I'm fine with 1 package of firewood and food each.",452,1
mturk_agent_2,I really need 2 packages of water ,452,2
mturk_agent_1,"I get dehydrated quickly, so given my condition, I'm not able to compromise on water.",452,2
mturk_agent_2,okay well I will take 2 foods and 2 firewoods then ,452,3
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you so much for understanding, I'm fine with that.",452,3
mturk_agent_2,I guess that works out good because I need firewood to cook the extra food,452,4

mturk_agent_1,Hi there! I am excited to share these additional camping supplies with you!,453,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, same here! I'm glad that we all have our own basic necessities, but extra is always wonderful. 🙂 What are you most interested in?",453,0
mturk_agent_1,I am most interested in water! My husband and I are traveling with our newborn and we need as much water as possible!🙂,453,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ah, I see! I am in the same boat. We are camping somewhere where there is no source of water and it's very hot. Hm, let's see how to go about this",453,1
mturk_agent_1,what else is a priority for you?,453,2
mturk_agent_2,"Firewood is definitely important as well! Last time I went camping we ran out pretty fast, so I want to be extra prepared. 🙂",453,2
mturk_agent_1,Oh no! I can see why that would be extra important to you! I will give you two of the firewood for two of the water,453,3
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds good to me! I think since water is pretty important on a camping trip (especially with a baby!), and since you are getting 2 extra packages of water, may I ask that I get 2 of the food packages? I have 2 (always hungry) preschoolers joining us haha! 🙂 I can never seem to keep them full",453,3
mturk_agent_1,"I wish there was a way to split that third package of food in half because I am so worried for my husband's diabetes, he constantly needs food as well ☹️",453,4
mturk_agent_2,"That's fine, I will just take 1! Sounds good?",453,4

mturk_agent_1,"I recently bought two new puppies, and they are coming on the trip. I could really use the extra water for them!",454,1
mturk_agent_2,"Awww. That sounds reasonable to me. I'm hoping to have a birthday dinner for my dad on the trip, so I'd appreciate some more food and a little more firewood.",454,1
mturk_agent_1,Happy birthday to your dad!! You can have all of the food if I can have all of the water. 🙂,454,2
mturk_agent_2,That,454,2
mturk_agent_1,"Will that work for you? If so, we can talk about the firewood. 🙂",454,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, submitted too early! That sounds good to me! If I can have all the food, you can take 2 of the firewood and I'll take one. Plus you take all of the water.",454,3
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds great, thanks!! 🙂 🙂",454,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I would like to keep the 3 extra packages of firewood an 2 extra packages of water.  You can have all 3 packages of water and 1 package of food.",455,0
mturk_agent_2,That's just too big of an ask. How about I get 3 firewood and 1 water and you can have the rest,455,1
mturk_agent_1,I really need the extra firewood.  I hiked 5 miles o this camping spot and I need the extra firewood to stay warm and to keep the wild animals away at night.,455,1
mturk_agent_2,"I really need some of the firewood too. I am expecting a big group of people to attend, and I can really use it. it gets really cold at night where we camp. What do you suggest is a more fair deal to the both of us?",455,2
mturk_agent_1,I will give you one extra package of firewood. You can have all 3 packages of food 1 package of water for your group of friends. Does that sound good?🙂,455,2
mturk_agent_2,"I appreciate the offer but if you're getting more of the firewood, I need some of the water too. How about you get 2 firewood and 2 food and I keep the rest.",455,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, but I need at least 1 package of water. So, I can give you 2 packages of water along with the 1 package of firewood and the 3 packages of food. Do we have a deal?🙂",455,3
mturk_agent_2,"So i get 1 firewood, 2 water and 3 food?",455,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hello! We're going camping and need some additional supplies. The primary need right now is firewood! We can spare water, but some additional food for the six kids is needed!",456,0
mturk_agent_2,Wow. You took six kids on this trip? I would say you will definitely need food!,456,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yup! But we did think ahead and ordered extra rations for them. Food is second priority, so maybe we could have 2 of those? You could have all of the water rations.",456,1
mturk_agent_2,"I definitely need water but I didn’t bring enough shelter. Thus, I will need to keep my fire going. ",456,1
mturk_agent_1,We have a shortage of trees in this area. Could we split those up evenly? I think that would be fair. Something like 2 of each with you getting the most of the water.,456,2
mturk_agent_2,I really need some firewood. ,456,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, that's priority #1 for us as well. If I give you one, could you give us most of the food and water then?",456,3
mturk_agent_2,I definitely need one firewood. I can use either one more water or one more food. I will leave up to you. ,456,3
mturk_agent_1,"Gotcha. I could hand over a package of firewood, 1 food, and water as well. Maybe we'll try out a suggestion and see if it works for both our families.",456,4
mturk_agent_2,I will take one firewood and one food. I will give you one water. ,456,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,456,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,456,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I would like to get firewood because I would like to sit by the campfire in the evening.",457,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi there. I was really hoping to have the firewood because I am afraid my children would be cold.,457,0
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, so we have 3 packages, what about if you get 2 and I get 1?",457,1
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you, 2 packages of firewood would work.",457,1
mturk_agent_2,"So could I get 2 food, if you get 1 food?",457,2
mturk_agent_1,How many persons are you feeding? I am feeding 2 adults and 2 children.,457,2
mturk_agent_2,"2 adults and 3 children, so if I get 2 food and 1 water, you could get 1 food and 2 water? ",457,3
mturk_agent_1,I believe we can work with 1 food and 2 waters.🙂,457,3
mturk_agent_2,"So 1 package of firewood, 2 food and 1 water for me and 2 packages of  firewood, 1 food and 2 waters for you? Sound good? ",457,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes I get 2 packages of firewood, 1 food and 2 waters. Sounds like a good deal.🙂",457,4

mturk_agent_1,"I am about to go on a charity event with a kid from the make a wish foundation, I would like to get some firewood and maybe some food for his trip so he wont be cold and hungry at least.",458,1
mturk_agent_2,I can give you 2 units of food. How much firewood do you need?,458,2
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking about 2 units of firewood and 1 unit of food and one unit of water, what are you going to be needing this for?",458,2
mturk_agent_2,I can do that. I am going camping in the fall with my family so we need a lot of food. We're camping by the lake so if you want I can give you an extra unit of water.,458,3
mturk_agent_1,"sure thats sounds fair, so that would leave you with two units of food one unit of firewood and one unit of water then?",458,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds fair to me. Have fun with the kiddo!,458,4

mturk_agent_2,I'm hoping so too. What's most valuable to you?,459,1
mturk_agent_1,"Water, what about you? ",459,1
mturk_agent_2,"Food, but I definitely do need some water, too. Can you live with taking 2 waters?",459,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, can you live with two foods? ",459,2
mturk_agent_2,I can. How about firewood? I would like 2 if possible.,459,3
mturk_agent_1,Well there are only 3.,459,3
mturk_agent_2,"Of course. Since you're getting more water, I was hoping to get 2 firewood, and you could have the remaining 1. Would that work for you?",459,4
mturk_agent_1,"Water was my high priority and food was your's, so I think we already split the difference there. ",459,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, so how do you propose splitting the firewood?",459,5
mturk_agent_1,"Can we split a bundle, in the real world that would be cool.  ",459,5
mturk_agent_2,I wish we could. I would be down for that. 🙂 That seems the most fair to me. How about you enter the trade deal on your end?,459,6
mturk_agent_1,Deal. ,459,6
mturk_agent_2,"Then let me pass it back to you, and you can enter the trade, then hit submit. I'll be ready.",459,7

mturk_agent_1,"Hi there, i appreciate your initial offer. ",460,0
mturk_agent_2,What is your offer on the additional packages?,460,1
mturk_agent_1,I would be willing to give you all of the firewood (3) and two of the water (2) while I get the rest,460,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ok great, are you going to be ok with getting your own water and firewood during the trip?",460,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think that I will be able to, so I'd like to offer you those extras.🙂",460,2
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you, it would have been difficult for me to get more firewood and I appreciate the additional water. So I get 3 firewood, 2 water and 0 food.",460,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I think that deal will be the most helpful to both of us. I appreciate the food, which is important to me.",460,3
mturk_agent_2,"You are welcome. Thank you for being so understanding, the extra packages are really going to come in handy for me!🙂",460,4

mturk_agent_1,Hello there.  That deal most definitely will not work for me. ,461,0
mturk_agent_2,"OK, If i take all 3 of the foods and 1 of the waters you can have the remaining packages ",461,1
mturk_agent_1,"I need to eat too, especially if I want to go on a long hike.  How about I take 2 foods, 2 waters, and 1 firewood? ",461,1
mturk_agent_2,"I am sorry that will not work for me, how about i take 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood and you can have the rest? That way we each get some of each",461,2
mturk_agent_1,I think that sounds pretty good.  I look forward to singing songs around the fire and going on extra hikes. ,461,2
mturk_agent_2,fantastic! and i look forward to getting my kids noses out of the electronics! ,461,3
mturk_agent_1,"I hear that. I think all of us could use a ""digital detox"" from time to time.  ",461,3
mturk_agent_2,Especially right now when everything is closed with the COVID pandemic! ,461,4
mturk_agent_1,It will be good to decompress and get away from the madness. ,461,4

mturk_agent_2,Hi how is it going?,462,0
mturk_agent_1,It took a while to load but good.,462,1
mturk_agent_2,Let's talk about how we can split the camping supplies,462,1
mturk_agent_1,Ok I think we should split evenly,462,2
mturk_agent_2,"yes we should come to a fair deal, what are your priority items?",462,2
mturk_agent_1,"Food is highest, firewood is medium, and water lowest. You?",462,3
mturk_agent_2,"I have food, water and firewood.",462,3
mturk_agent_1,Ok so whoever gets more wood should get something else higher,462,4
mturk_agent_2,"How bout this deal, me - 3 water, 2 firewood, you 3 food, 1 firewood",462,4
mturk_agent_1,Sounds alright,462,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,462,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,462,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi there. Hope you too are looking forward to this much needed camping trip. What are your needs in terms of extra packages?,463,0
mturk_agent_2,"Since this is the first time for the family to be camping, having plenty of food for everyone is on the top of my list.",463,0
mturk_agent_1,I am fine with you having the 3 foods. Is it okay if I have 3 water units We are fasting and need lots of hydration.,463,1
mturk_agent_2,Are you sure you need all of the water? It would be nice to have some extra.,463,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, we do need the water pretty badly. But I guess wanting all the water is stingy so I will pack extra water since we are not packing food. How about you guys receive 1 water and 3 food units?",463,2
mturk_agent_2,"If you feel you absolutely need the 3 waters, I will let you have them provided I can have 2 firewoods along with the 3 foods.",463,2
mturk_agent_1,"That is so nice of you. Being that you have family, you might need more firewood for cooking for the crew! Do you agree? And how many kids are you traveling with? ",463,3
mturk_agent_2,I have 2 kids and want to make sure they stay warm.  The firewood will go a long way in keeping them comfortable.,463,3
mturk_agent_1,"I am leaving my little ones home. I feel a little guilty but am going forward with the plan! So, I input our order that you guys receive 3 food, 2 firewood, and no water. Are we in agreement?",463,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes. That sounds fair to me.,463,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,463,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,463,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello I'm interested in obtaining more of the water and food, but don't need any extra firewood🙂",464,0
mturk_agent_1,Well I am really in the same position as you are. Suppose I take 2 waters and only 1 food? ,464,0
mturk_agent_2,"I get really sweaty when I hike, so I really need to get at least 2 of the waters.",464,1
mturk_agent_1,My friend is joining me tomorrow so there will be two of us. I really need the extra water so we both can stay hydrated. You can have all the food and 2 of the firewood packs if I get 2 of the water packs. 🙂,464,1
mturk_agent_2,"I understand, but I don't need any extra firewood.  You could have 2 food, 3 firewood, and 1 water?🙂",464,2
mturk_agent_1,Well I am going to have to think about this deal. Perhaps I can contact my friend and see if he can get some extra water. He is a big eater so the food may come in handy. ,464,2
mturk_agent_2,That would make things better for me.  ,464,3
mturk_agent_1,Can I ask you why you need so much water for one person? ,464,3
mturk_agent_2,"Hiking in the summer, I sweat a lot and I don't want to risk getting dehydrating and sick out in the woods.",464,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well this might work out, I will agree to take 2 food, 3 firewood and 1 water. I think we will be fine because we are not going hiking. We are going to sit around campfire and catch up on old times. Good deal for both of us if you agree. 🙂",464,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,464,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,464,5
mturk_agent_2,"How's it going?  If it's alright with you, you can have all of the water and I'll take all of the firewood.  We can work out a deal on the food as well.",465,0
mturk_agent_1,I have circulatory issued due to a heart condition and cold quickly. I would appreciate if I could get at least 2 of the firewood. You can have 2 of the food so you won't get hungry. 🙂,465,0
mturk_agent_2,"I was planning on building a big bonfire for the evening.  There'd be plenty of room if you wanted to join for warmth.  I'm a bit hungry and would appreciate the extra food.  You can have all of the water if you'd like.  If you warm it by the bonfire, it may be useful to soak in to improve your circulation.",465,1
mturk_agent_1,I get tired to easy so I probably won't be much fun at a bonfire ☹️. I really do appreciate the offer though. I would think the extra food would do you more good for your party. ,465,1
mturk_agent_2,"The extra food would be appreciated.  How about if I take just two each of the firewood and food, and you can have the remainder, plus all of the water?",465,2
mturk_agent_1,I am just concerned that only 1 firewood might make it so I'm too cold to function. ,465,2
mturk_agent_2,"If you boil the water above the fire, it will provide additional heat over time.  You would also be able to make tea, which would warm you up from the inside as well, better than any fire would.  That would probably be most beneficial to you.  I really do need the 2 firewood if there's any chance of making a bonfire for my party.",465,3
mturk_agent_1,I am allergic to tea and coffee. I wonder if the smaller fire would be more quaint for everyone to sit around. ,465,3
mturk_agent_2,"It really wouldn't do the job that well at all.  You could always prepare hot cocoa or use your share of the food to make a warm stew.  I really do need at least the two firewood and a couple of food.  You can have all the water to make a hearty and hot stew to get your through the night, though.",465,4
mturk_agent_1,I can't eat much anyway because of the health issues. You could have all of the food if I could get the extra firewood. That would still give you an extra firewood in addition to the basic supply and lots of extra food for your party. I'm sure they would love having some of the stew you mentioned.,465,4
mturk_agent_2,"Well, how about I take just the one extra firewood, plus all of the food, and one of the water so that I can make stew?  Would that work for you?",465,5
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good. I hope your party is wonderful.,465,5

mturk_agent_1,I am fine. How is your camping trip going?,466,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'm just finishing the final details of packing. I'm a little concerned I don't have enough of a few things. It is supposed to be over 100 degrees where we are going, and I don't think I have enough water. I'm concerned my kids are going to get dehydrated. I really could use 3 extra packages. ",466,1
mturk_agent_1,That will not be possible i am afraid. I need at least 2 packages of water too. I have some tabs that i have to take with water regularly.,466,2
mturk_agent_2,I don't think I will be able to give you 2 waters. I'm desperate. I need at least 2. I would give you 1 if I could get 3 packages of food. I would give you all the firewood. ,466,2
mturk_agent_1,If i give you 3 packages of food then i will take 3 packages of firewood.,466,3
mturk_agent_2,So I get 2 waters and 3 foods. and you get the rest?,466,3
mturk_agent_1,I could use one food too. How am i going to survive without eating anything?,466,4
mturk_agent_2,Okay So I get 2 waters and 2 foods and you get the rest?,466,4
mturk_agent_1,Don't you think it is a fair deal?,466,5

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I am in need of more water than just one,could you possibly allow me to have two and the other items are fine",468,0
mturk_agent_1,I have a bunch of kids and need extra water. I can give you 2 food packs instead.,468,1
mturk_agent_2,"Then i understand, i have kidney issues but i would rather go without then take away from a family",468,1
mturk_agent_1,If you need water for a medical issue the of course you can have two waters.,468,2
mturk_agent_2,"You are being very kind then, im elderly so trying to make fresh water by boiling it from getting it from a river was concerning to me. How about you take all three of the food for your kiddo's",468,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds fair. The kids can bathe in the stream. We are good with 2 food packs.,468,3
mturk_agent_2,"Lol, wish i could. Then you take all 3 of the firewood, I'll take 2 of the Water and 1 of the food, sound good?",468,3

mturk_agent_1,Hello there. I'd like to discuss making a deal.,469,0
mturk_agent_2,"yes, what would you like?",469,0
mturk_agent_1,I was thinking I will take all the food and water. You can have the firewood. ,469,1
mturk_agent_2,that's not going to work for me. I need to keep at least 2 foods and 1 firewood but you can have all the water.,469,1
mturk_agent_1,Are you most interested in the food? 😮,469,2
mturk_agent_2,"yeah I didn't pack enough for my trip, so I'm a little worried about my supplies.",469,2
mturk_agent_1,I see. I wouldn't want you to go hungry. ☹️,469,3

mturk_agent_1,Yep.  I am excited.  I could really use the decompression and time away from society. ,47,0
mturk_agent_2,"I agree, can't wait to unplug. As far as supplies go, I think its going to be hot and sunny where I'm going, wouldn't mind a bunch of extra water.",47,1
mturk_agent_1,Water is extremely important to me too.  I can give you 2 waters if you give me all 3 firewoods. ,47,1
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, ok, thats pretty fair. I do have a larger group going as well, so would it be okay if I got 2 extra food then?",47,2
mturk_agent_1,I think that will work. ,47,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, great!🙂 Just to recap, I'll get 2 water, 0 firewood, 2 food, you get the rest.",47,3
mturk_agent_1,That's right.  Thanks for making this part of planning for the trip easy,47,3

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, what do you need the most for your camping trip?",470,0
mturk_agent_1,"ideally some firewood, it got soaked due to me being caught in the rain. what do you need the most?",470,0
mturk_agent_2,I also need more firewood.  I thought I would be able to find enough around the campsite but I guess that rain got us both 😮,470,1
mturk_agent_1,"yeah, horrible way to start the trip but I am sure it will get better. if i can have 2 of the fire wood you could have all three of the extra water",470,1
mturk_agent_2,"🙂 Okay, I'll consider that since I do need some more water.  How should we split up the food?",470,2
mturk_agent_1,well if your getting all 3 food and 1 of the fire wood how about i get 2 food and you get one? then it is more or less even,470,2
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good to me!🙂,470,3
mturk_agent_1,"okay so just to double check i would get 2 firewood, and two food  and you would get 1 firewood and all the water and 1 food?",470,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yep, looks right to me",470,4
mturk_agent_1,sounds awesome glad we could come to a deal where we both win 🙂,470,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I was wondering if you might want to split up the extra supplies with me. I was hoping for some food as I would have trouble gathering it up. ",471,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I don't mind giving you more of the food as long as I could have more of the water and firewood. 🙂,471,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I do need some of each, what about I take 3 food and 1 each of the other two?",471,1
mturk_agent_1,I don't mind taking 2 of the water as I need it for a medical condition and 2 firewood however I would like to get 1 of the food.,471,1
mturk_agent_2,You need water the most?,471,2
mturk_agent_1,I am constantly thirsty and having water on hand is needed. Why is gathering food an issue for you?,471,2
mturk_agent_2,"I am not able to get around as much to gather the food. It could require a lot of walking and I might find nothing. What if I took 2 food, 1 water, and 2 firewood, would that be good for you?",471,3
mturk_agent_1,How about I take 3 water and 2 firewood and you take the rest?,471,3
mturk_agent_2,I think I can live with that.,471,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, going camping?🙂",472,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes. Can you help me to give some extra fodd?,472,1
mturk_agent_2,"I am willing to give you the good, though it would help us--we have a large group.  I really would like to take the water.  We are camping out in a primitive campsite with no running water.",472,1
mturk_agent_1,Ya sure. ,472,2
mturk_agent_2,Sorry for the type--I meant 'food' not 'good'.🙂,472,2
mturk_agent_1,Yes i can understand.,472,3
mturk_agent_2,We will be in an area where there is not much firewood to collect. You have to bring it in.  We hope to cook with it and keep warm in the evenings.  I am hoping to take at least 2 firewood packages.,472,3
mturk_agent_1,I will give you water. Firewood also need for me because of my health condition i want some warm.,472,4
mturk_agent_2,Will one extra firewood be enough to keep you warm?,472,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,472,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,472,5
mturk_agent_2,I'm not sure why you entered a deal we did not agree on.  I can leave you the three food and one firewood.,472,6

mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,472,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,472,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, can we make a deal?",473,0
mturk_agent_1,Of course! Are you going camping too?,473,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes.  I have 2 children so I was thinking that I will need extra water. 🙂,473,1
mturk_agent_1,"I too need extra water, but I'm willing to negotiate on the other things if you are! 🙂",473,1
mturk_agent_2,"If I take 2 waters, will you accept 2 firewood?",473,2
mturk_agent_1,"You take 2 waters, I'll take 2 firewood and 2 food?",473,2
mturk_agent_2,What about you take 1 water and the firewood.  I take 2 waters and all the food,473,3
mturk_agent_1,"That leaves me with very little. Can I have 1 water, 2 firewood, and 2 food?",473,3
mturk_agent_2,you would get 1 water and all 3 firewood.  I would get 2 water and all 3 food.  You have one less than me but the food is worth less,473,4
mturk_agent_1,I will make it work. Let's make a deal!,473,4
mturk_agent_2,Perfect. 🙂,473,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,473,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,473,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I am looking at extra items for my camping trip and would like to have 3 firewoods, 3 foods and 2 waters.",474,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, I am excited to go camping too!  Would you mind sharing your top priority items with me so that we can come up with a fair deal?  Ideally I would love 3 firewoods, 3 foods, and 2 waters just like you aha.  But perhaps we can each get at least 3 packages of our highest priority item ",474,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hmmm, I think I really need the firewood.  I brought softwoods and they burn out quickly so I don't think I'll have enough wood to keep me going through the night. I get kinda scared without the fire.  What is your priority?",474,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, well firewood is also my top priority since it will be so cold tonight.  But I would be willing to take only 1 firewood (and give you 2) as long as I got 2 foods and 2 waters ",474,1
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you for the offer on firewood.  I think that sounds fair.  However, I really would like at least 2 waters as well. ",474,2
mturk_agent_2,Hmm unfortunately I can't budge since I would be accepting less of my top priority item.  It sounds fair to me though; I'd get 5 items in total but less of my top priority and you would get 4 items in total but more of your top priority,474,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, how about if I take 2 firewoods and all of the food and you can have all of the waters? I have a device that I can make clean water, but will need more calories to do so! 🙂",474,3
mturk_agent_2,"Can't do!  Water is my lowest priority since I already brought iodine drops to purify water myself aha.  I still think it's fair if I get 1 firewood 2 food and 2 water (or if it helps you to feel better, I can take 2 firewood and 1 food and 1 water)",474,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok...Then how about if I just take 2 firewood, 1 water, and just 1 food?  I think that is what you proposed before.",474,4
mturk_agent_2,Yup that works for me!,474,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,474,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,474,5
mturk_agent_1,I would like all the firewood and two packages of water. You can have the rest.🙂,475,0
mturk_agent_2,"I want all of the water, two firewood, and one food.",475,0
mturk_agent_1,Why do you need all the water and little food?,475,1
mturk_agent_2,I need to stay hydrated because the weather is hot. I am trying to lose weight so I do not need much food.,475,1
mturk_agent_1,😮I see. I have a medical condition that causes my veins to close if I get too cold. I need more firewood to make sure I don't freeze at night.,475,2
mturk_agent_2,Would two of the firewood be enough?,475,2
mturk_agent_1,"Maybe... I could perhaps do with 2 firewood. But, I would like at least one packet of water.",475,3
mturk_agent_2,I would be OK with two packages of water.,475,3
mturk_agent_1,"Good. 2 packages of wood for me. 1 for you. 2 packages of water for you, and one for me. How should we divide the food?",475,4
mturk_agent_2,I will take 2 packages of food and 1 for you.,475,4
mturk_agent_1,"😮I thought you didn't need so much food, because of your diet....",475,5
mturk_agent_2,You are right. I will take 1 package of food.,475,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,475,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,475,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi there! Ready to go camping? ,476,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes I am,476,0
mturk_agent_1,"Great! I'll be going to the Catskills, in NY. Where are you planning on going?",476,1
mturk_agent_2,Antarctica! I am going to need as much firewood as I can get.,476,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ha, woah that's exotic! I'll need some firewood as well, but maybe not as much as you! I'm planning on going hiking a lot, and will need some extra water, as, again, ill be hiking a lot",476,2
mturk_agent_2,I will offer 3 water to you! You will maybe need more food with that much exercise? How about 2 food? I really need that extra firewood. Remember that the Catskills probably has some extra wood around.,476,2
mturk_agent_1,"That works for me, you can have the firewood then!",476,3
mturk_agent_2,Alright that sounds great. ,476,3
mturk_agent_1,"Great! so, for you, 2 wood, 1 food, me 3 water 2 food",476,4
mturk_agent_2,3 wood is what i thought the deal was,476,4
mturk_agent_1,"yes, sorry, I meant to type 3 haha",476,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,476,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,476,6
mturk_agent_1,hi how are you,477,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am well, thank you.  Yourself?",477,0
mturk_agent_1,"good here, I will need 3 water as I need it to survive",477,1
mturk_agent_2,I need water as well.  I require it for subsistence,477,1
mturk_agent_1,how many water you need?,477,2
mturk_agent_2,"In a perfect world, all the water 🙂",477,2
mturk_agent_1,"that won't be fair, how about I get 1 water, 3 food and 1 firewood, that way u get the most water",477,3
mturk_agent_2,"Interesting.  If I decided to forgo water completely, would you accept giving me everything else?",477,3
mturk_agent_1,"no, at the most i can do is i get 2 water, 2 food and 0 firewood or I get 1 water, 3 food and 1 firewood",477,4
mturk_agent_2,"But you get everything you wanted. You said you needed 3 water, I offered it to you.",477,4
mturk_agent_1,"but i can't give you 3 food and 3 firewood, thats 6 items vs the 3 water",477,5
mturk_agent_2,"Sure you can.  If you really want water the most, why would you care about the rest as much?😮",477,5
mturk_agent_1,"most does not mean i have to neglect the rest, anyways either a) I get 3 water, 2 food and 0 firewood or b) I get 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood",477,6
mturk_agent_2,That is simply unacceptable.,477,6
mturk_agent_1,"well how about i get 2 water, 2 food and 1 firewood",477,7
mturk_agent_2,Here is the offer.  For you: 3 water 0 food 1 firewood,477,7
mturk_agent_1,"what about instead of firewood, I get 1 food, so it will be 3 water, 1 food and 0 firewood",477,8
mturk_agent_2,"Ok so 3 water 0 firewood and 1 food, I can work with that",477,8
mturk_agent_1,ok,477,9

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,477,10
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I hope you are having a good day! I would like to know what packages you need the most.",478,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I'm having a wonderful day.🙂 Thanks for asking. I hope yours is a wonderful day as well. I would like 2 firewood, 2 water, and 1 food. How about you?",478,0
mturk_agent_1,"Glad to hear it! I am really looking to get extra firewood, so I would like to make a compromise. If I gave you all the food, could I have more firewood?",478,1
mturk_agent_2,I like watching the camp fire all night. What is your reason for needing more firewood?,478,1
mturk_agent_1,"That does sound very nice. I would like more in order to stay warm, and for cooking some delicious food.",478,2
mturk_agent_2,"I see. So what you want is  2 more fire wood, and 1 water? Is that what i'm to understand.",478,2
mturk_agent_1,"Since you would also like firewood, I propose 2 firewood, 2 water to me, and you get 1 wood, 1 water, and all the food to make up for it.",478,3
mturk_agent_2,Okay I can agree to that deal.🙂,478,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's fantastic, I'm glad we came to something we both agree with",478,4
mturk_agent_2,Me too. I hope you have a wonderful camping trip.🙂,478,4

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,478,5
mturk_agent_1,hi  i was wondering if i could get 3 packages of firewood?,479,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hey there, unfortunately, I'm in a bit of a quandary with firewood too, as I am going to a place where it's fairly cold and will need more for heat. ",479,0
mturk_agent_1,"thats terrible! i broke my leg and wont be able to collect my own firewood , could i maybe get 2 packages? ☹️",479,1
mturk_agent_2,Terribly sorry to hear that; it sounds like you won't be able to camp much in that condition. I assume you have someone coming along to help you because of your leg?,479,1
mturk_agent_1,just a bunch of children under 5 who wont be able to gather firewood. so i desperately need at least 2,479,2
mturk_agent_2,"I see, well it sounds like you're going to need some additional food with those children. How about I provide you with some additional food and you can help me with my need for heat with firewood?",479,2
mturk_agent_1,okay how i take all 3 food and 1 firewood?,479,3
mturk_agent_2,"The firewood sounds like a solid deal; I would need a little food though to assist me. The good news is since there's a stream near me, I won't need any additional water, so I am happy to provide you with all of the additional water.",479,3
mturk_agent_1,i am not able to do that unfortunately i desperately need firewood. ,479,4
mturk_agent_2,"Perhaps I wasn't clear, so if I take 2 firewood, you take 1; I would just need some help with some of the food. Is that reasonable?",479,4
mturk_agent_1,i guues,479,5
mturk_agent_2,"So let's make sure this is reasonable; Firewood - 2 for me, 1 for you; Water 2 for you, 1 for me, and you can have all of the water?",479,5
mturk_agent_1,sounds good. 1 firewood for me  2 food for me and i can have all water. to clarify. sorry about typos,479,6
mturk_agent_2,"No worries, ok that sounds good; I'm going to submit the deal.",479,6
mturk_agent_1,nice 🙂,479,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,479,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,479,8
mturk_agent_1,Hello. 🙂 What item did you need a little extra of?,48,0
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you for asking, I would really like some extra fire wood as I usually get cold and scared at night so I can keep a fire going.",48,0
mturk_agent_1,I'd be willing to give you all my firewood if you could give me all the water.,48,1
mturk_agent_2,"I do need at least one extra water bottle in case the fire goes out of control, but I am willing to forgo any food as I can forage for food.",48,1
mturk_agent_1,Alright. Thanks. I only ask for so much of the water because I am overweight and I know while camping I'll work up a huge sweat.,48,2
mturk_agent_2,"Great, that sounds good to me, are you okay with keeping all the food or would 3 be too much?",48,2
mturk_agent_1,I'd be ok with keeping all the food. I do eat a bit too much and if for some reason I get lost it would be helpful to have!,48,3
mturk_agent_2,"I agree with that, so you would get the two water and three food and I would get one water and three firewood?",48,3
mturk_agent_1,Yeah. If that's alright with you? It rained here recently but I bought a top of the line tent and sleeping bag so if I do run out of firewood I'll still be ok.,48,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I'm glad we could come to an agreement, I will submit the deal now.",48,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,48,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,48,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello there 🙂,480,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I hope we can work together on an offer that benefits both of us. Do you think it's OK?🙂",480,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes definitely!  I am pretty easy to work with and would like a deal that will help us both out as much as possible.,480,1
mturk_agent_1, The item I need the most is water because I need to hydrate to stay strong and achieve my goals. And you?,480,1
mturk_agent_2,"I would say water as well because I am very active and build up thirst as a result.  However, I would be willing to compromise on things to allow you to have more water.",480,2
mturk_agent_1,The item that I need the least is firewood because I will dedicate myself to look it up at the camp. And you?,480,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes I think we have the same preferences.  I do not get cold easily and will bring a heavy sleeping bag.  ,480,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, it gets a little complicated. But let's see what you think if I grab: 3 water 1 food and 0 firewood? And you would take: 0 of water, 2 of food and 3 of firewood",480,3
mturk_agent_2,"That is not a bad offer.  However, I would like at least 1 water for myself.  I would be willing to allow you 2 of the 3 waters though.",480,4
mturk_agent_1,Ok what do you think then if I give you 1 more water and you give me 1 more firewood.,480,4
mturk_agent_2,That is quite fair.  I would agree to that :)  Should we go ahead and submit it?,480,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,480,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,480,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello I hope we can negotiate so that we are both satisfied. Do you think it's OK?🙂,481,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes that would be great 🙂🙂,481,0
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, what item do you need the most and which item do you need the least? That information would help me think of an offer that suits both of us.🙂",481,1
mturk_agent_1,I need   food and water the most . There are 3 of us.🙂,481,1
mturk_agent_2,Your most needed item is water or food?,481,2
mturk_agent_1,Most needed is both food and water. I guess food is my highest priority .🙂,481,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok perfect, the item I need the most is water because I need to hydrate.  What do you think if I give you 2 food and I keep 2 of water. ",481,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ii understand , the problem  is ctheere is 3 of us. What if  we have 2 food and 2 water and you have 2 firewood ?🙂",481,3
mturk_agent_2,"The object I need the most is WATER, so I cannot give you 2, I am giving you 2 FOOD since it is what you most need. Remember that we must both be satisfied for this to work🙂",481,4
mturk_agent_1,"(sorry for the misspellings on above post, my keyboard does that) Ok since that  is your highest priority , I have 2 food 1 water and 2 firewood ? Is that agreeable ?🙂",481,4
mturk_agent_2,"What do you think about this offer, I will give you 2 of FOOD since it is what you need the most, 1 of WATER since it is what I need and 2 of WOOD, I will have less wood but we will both be satisfied.",481,5
mturk_agent_1,Yes very agreeable ! Thank you .🙂,481,5

mturk_agent_2,Hi there. Have you ever been camping?,482,0
mturk_agent_1,"I have, i love camping! How about you?",482,0
mturk_agent_2,"I have not, but I don't really have an interest for it, either.",482,1
mturk_agent_1,"Thats a shame, i am sure you would like it if you give it a try, especially if you build a large fire 🙂",482,1
mturk_agent_2,"I was going to say, the fire would be probably one of the few things I would be interested in! I love being warm.",482,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well you can take all the firewood if it will help, would it be ok if i get all the food in return?",482,2
mturk_agent_2,That works for me. How would you like to divide the water?,482,3
mturk_agent_1,"I am ok with you taking two waters since you are new to camping, does that seem fair to you?",482,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that seems fair to me.",482,4
mturk_agent_1,"So you get 3 firewoods and two waters and i get 3 foods and one water, deal?",482,4
mturk_agent_2,we have a deal! great speaking with you today 🙂,482,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,482,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,482,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi! How about I receive 3 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water?",483,0
mturk_agent_2,"I can't do that. It would leave me with no food at all. How about I take 2 food, and 1 firewood, and 1 water?",483,0
mturk_agent_1,"I really need more food than 1. I am worried about running out. I could take 2 food, and give you 1 food, 2 firewood, and 2 water.",483,1
mturk_agent_2,"That is a very generous offer, which I very much appreciate. But I am also worried that I could run out. What if I take 2 foods, give you 2 firewoods, and 1 water?  ",483,1
mturk_agent_1,"Would you be willing to give me 1 food, 2 firewood, and 2 water?",483,2
mturk_agent_2,"I could make that work 🙂 I'm sorry if I came off mean, I'm just trying to make sure I'll be ok. I don't camp often, so I'm not sure how to prepare.",483,2
mturk_agent_1,I understand. What are you using the extra food for?,483,3
mturk_agent_2,"I brought some pre-packed snacks, and a few sandwiches. I'm hoping there are no hungry animals around. What about you?",483,3
mturk_agent_1,"I was hoping to get some extra food for some picky eaters, but if they are hungry they will eat!",483,4
mturk_agent_2,"Oh no! I know how picky eaters can be. I'm sorry to hear that. So are you thinking I'll give you the one food, and 2 firewoods, and 2 waters? Will that work for you?",483,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that works.",483,5
mturk_agent_2,Deal!,483,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,483,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,483,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there, fellow camper! 🙂",484,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello 🙂 How are you?,484,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm great! Just getting excited to go camping and dreaming of all the food I'll eat! Do you have any extra food?,484,1
mturk_agent_1,"Let me ask you, do you need food most? If yes, what do you need second most?",484,1
mturk_agent_2,"I would love as much food as is available. I would also appreciate excess firewood, as I get cold.",484,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, it seems we both have the same priorities in food most and firewood second most. How about this, you take 2 packages of food, I will take 1. You give me 2 packages of firewood I will give you 1. We will then divide the water. Is that fair?",484,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds really fair! 🙂,484,3
mturk_agent_1,Would you be willing to give me 2 water and you take 1?,484,3
mturk_agent_2,I'll agree to that!,484,4
mturk_agent_1,Sounds good. Thank you for being flexible. ,484,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,484,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,484,5
mturk_agent_2,Hey there - looks like we are both going camping!  I'm from the South so firewood and water are a high priority for me.,485,0
mturk_agent_1,"Wow, thats awesome! Yes, I am! Well, that's great because water isn't super important for me. Firewood is though. ",485,0
mturk_agent_2,That sounds awesome - I'm sure we can come to an agreement on how to allocate that works for both of us.  ,485,1
mturk_agent_1,I agree that we will! I do love having food as well. Have lots of people coming.,485,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'm not as keen on food, so how does this sound.  I get 2 firewood, 2 waters, and 1 food.  You will get 2 food, 1 firewood, and 1 water. ",485,2
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, you're getting my top item there though. That still might work.",485,2
mturk_agent_2,I think it's pretty fair since we'll both get at least one of our top item (firewood) and you get more food (I assume your second priority) and I get more water (my second priority),485,3
mturk_agent_1,Well you're getting more on 2/3.,485,3
mturk_agent_2,True - but one of us has to 🙂.,485,4
mturk_agent_1,I understand. I do like food so we have a deal.,485,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,485,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,485,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello how are you?,486,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I am doing well. How about you?,486,0

mturk_agent_1,Me too.🙂,486,1
mturk_agent_2,What are you looking for?,486,2
mturk_agent_1,Firewood. I need 3. What do you need?,486,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm looking for mostly water and food. I have some firewood, but I don't think I could trade all 3. ",486,3
mturk_agent_1,Ok. COuld I have all 3 if I gave you 3 food and 2 water?,486,3
mturk_agent_2,Would you do 3 water and 2 food? ,486,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, that would work for me",486,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,486,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,486,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how are you? ",487,0
mturk_agent_2,Am fine what about you?,487,0
mturk_agent_1,"Good thanks! So I'm hoping I can get all of the Food, but am willing to negotiate on the other items. ",487,1
mturk_agent_2,Ohh food?.Thats a very essential property over here.I mean very important.Do you really need it that bad?,487,1
mturk_agent_1,"It's my top priority, but if you need some, I'd need more water and firewood",487,2
mturk_agent_2,It aslo my top priority but i would not if u give me 3 packages of water and  2 firewood in exchange for all food.Agree?,487,2
mturk_agent_1,sure that works,487,3
mturk_agent_2,Okay deal sealed?,487,3
mturk_agent_1,yea good with me. 3 food 1 firewood for me. 3 water and 2 firewood for you,487,4

mturk_agent_2,Good morning,488,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how goes it?",488,0
mturk_agent_2,It's going alright. What do you need the most to trade?,488,1
mturk_agent_1,"well, I run and could use some extra water. How about you?",488,1
mturk_agent_2,"That's a good reason! I don't run, but could use some water. ",488,2
mturk_agent_1,"How much were you thinking? I could also use some food, but really don't have much need for firewood.",488,2
mturk_agent_2,"How about we split? 2 water for you, and 1 for us, that way we can go on a fun hike. In exchange, could we also have all the firewood? We want to have a community fire and you're more than welcome!",488,3
mturk_agent_1,"So 2 waters for me, 1 for you, and all the fire wood. How about the food? Perhaps 1 for me and 2 for you? Sound reasonable?",488,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good to me!,488,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, by the way are you here with family or friends? ",488,4
mturk_agent_2,With a few friends. It's my birthday soon and we decided to go camping!,488,5
mturk_agent_1,🙂 Happy birthday! a little early. Let me toss you our agreement,488,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,488,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,488,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello 🙂,489,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello!,489,0
mturk_agent_1,Which item do you need the most?,489,1
mturk_agent_2,"Firewood, due to the area that we are going to. How about you? ",489,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh I see. You can have all 3 firewood if you are ok with me taking all 3 food.,489,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, well I'd love to get some of the food. What I took 2 firewood, 1 food and 1 water? ",489,2
mturk_agent_1,Sorry but I really need all 3 food. All the food I brought with me has spoiled because the AC in my car broke. ☹️,489,3
mturk_agent_2,I see - So are you saying I would take all 3 firewood and all 3 water and you just get food? ,489,3
mturk_agent_1,No. That's not what I am saying. You can take all 3 firewood and I would like all 3 food.,489,4
mturk_agent_2,"aha, i basically just said that. I was asking about the water. I said I would get all 3 firewood and all 3 water and you would get all the food (3)",489,4
mturk_agent_1,How about I take 2 water and you take 1 water?,489,5
mturk_agent_2,"I don't really think that's fair given you're taking all the food. I would be willing to do the following: 2 firewood, 0 food, 2 water",489,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,489,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,489,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, looking forward to camping. Wondering if you could help me out. I really need extra water.🙂",49,0
mturk_agent_1,I also need water.  I can give you 2 waters for 2 foods.,49,0
mturk_agent_2,I can do that. Would you also be able to give me one firewood?,49,1
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, I can spare that",49,1
mturk_agent_2,I really appreciate you being so kind. I have so much medication to take and have to make sure I take it with lots of water.,49,2
mturk_agent_1,Its ok,49,2
mturk_agent_2,Do you have help carrying all that extra firewood? Could be heavy?,49,3
mturk_agent_1,"I do not, would you like to help",49,3
mturk_agent_2,I'll help by taking a second one off your hands lol 🙂,49,4
mturk_agent_1,"sure, I can give you another one",49,4
mturk_agent_2,"OK, so 2 water and firewood for me and 2 food for you?",49,5
mturk_agent_1,"yes, that is correct",49,5
mturk_agent_2,"great, thanks. Have a fun time!",49,6
mturk_agent_1,"You too, you can enter it in.",49,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,49,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,49,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hello there, I'm trying to get some more water. I take medication that makes me dehydrated. Is there something you mite be looking for in exchange?",490,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm sorry to hear about that -- I've been needing water because my child is with me and I can't let them get dehydrated since they're so young. Could we split the other items?,490,0
mturk_agent_1,We mite can do that. What do you need more of?,490,1
mturk_agent_2,do you want extra firewood if I take extra water?,490,1
mturk_agent_1,"At the least, Do you think I could get a little extra food if I give you some extra water as well?",490,2
mturk_agent_2,"yes, that would work for sure",490,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thats Good, I'm a big guy and like to eat when I'm out and about. ",490,3
mturk_agent_2,"what if we do 3 water for me, 3 food for you, and split the firewood?",490,3
mturk_agent_1,"No, that won't work. I told you in the begining I needed some water because of the medication I'm on.",490,4
mturk_agent_2,"that's right, how about i take 2 water, and you take 2 food?",490,4
mturk_agent_1,well I was going to let you have two being you have a kid to look out for. But i atleast need the one. So how about I get one water you get two. Then I get Two fire wood and two foods?,490,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,490,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,490,6
mturk_agent_1,I would really like to have 3 waters and 3 firewood because this is my first time camping and I don't have survival skills. ,491,0
mturk_agent_2,"You must be a comedian.  We will need to come to a compromise because there's no way that's going to happen.  I am like a water buffalo so I'll need at least two waters.  In addition, my family is from the South and will need firewood as well.",491,0
mturk_agent_1,I can't swim too. I think two waters will help me to survive on this trip and I will need at least two firewood to make fish or other food items for my family. ,491,1
mturk_agent_2,You don't need this water to swim.  You can take two of the food if you're worried about food.  I will take two water and two firewood since I have a large family to nourish and keep warm.  Your initial suggestion of 3  waters and firewood is laughable.  Please provide a realistic compromise.,491,1
mturk_agent_1,"If I take two waters, 1 firewood, and 2 food supplies, this will help me during the trip. It seems as if you are more skilled than I am on a camping trip. Please consider my request☹️",491,2
mturk_agent_2,"LOL - not a chance.  You're going to have to give me more than that.  I am more skilled and thus need firewood.  How about this...I will take 3 firewood and 2 food.  You can take all the water because you're so non-skilled in the wilderness. I am going to hunt for my food, but again I have a large family.  I am not considering your request  at all.  We will need to come to a decision relatively soon.",491,2
mturk_agent_1,"I understand your preferences. If I take all of the water, 1 firewood, and 2 food your family will still have the opportunity to have a good camping trip and I can learn to survive on this trip. Please consider my request again.☹️",491,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok - you're not being reasonable at all.  If you're so incompetent at going camping, maybe you should stay home and I can take all the supplies. How's that for an excellent offer?  All for me and 0 for you.",491,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think it would be good to come to a compromise. If I take all of the water and have the 2 foods, you can take all of the firewood as you originally proposed. Yet, I will have a tough time learning how to survive on a camping trip.😡",491,4
mturk_agent_2,"Again, that's not a fair compromise....You get all of what we both we want and more of another item.  Let me state it to you clearly so you can understand.  I WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT OFFER.  There is no chance you are getting all the water now that I think about it.  I will offer I get 1 water, 2 firewood, and 2 food.  If you can't come up with a reasonable offer, I will just walk away and we both get nothing.  I will survive because I will have skills.",491,4
mturk_agent_1,"I think this is reasonable because you have a big family. I will accept 2 waters, 1 firewood, and 1 food. ",491,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,491,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,491,6
mturk_agent_2,Can you help out? I can easily dehydrated can you give all the water packages to me?,492,0
mturk_agent_1,I can spare a little as I am currently taking medication that requires me to drink a lot. I can give you 2 bottles of water if you can give me 3 firewood,492,0
mturk_agent_2,I can't give you all the 3 firewood. We can share them. I can give you 1 firewood? Because I am too scared about dark. ☹️,492,1
mturk_agent_1,"I could give you 1 water for 1 firewood, most of my firewood got wet so is almost useless . Would you perhaps except some food for another unit of firewood?",492,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh. Let do some deal. If you give me all water bottles I will give you 2 firewood. Can you accept this,492,2
mturk_agent_1,i could give you 2 water bottles and 3 food if you can do 3 firewood,492,2
mturk_agent_2,OK. Are you need Extra food packages?,492,3
mturk_agent_1,"no, I am okay with food which is why I offered them all to you since all my firewood is ruined. I figured if i gave you 2 water and 3 food you might be able to spare the 3 firewood",492,3
mturk_agent_2,No I cant give you all the firewood. I will take atleast one firewood. Also can I have all three water bottles. ,492,4
mturk_agent_1,"the absolute most water I can spare is 2 and , my firewood is pretty much useless. I can give you 2 water and 1 food for 2 of your firewood that is my final offer",492,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok. I will have 2 water, 2 firewood and 1 food. Am I correct?",492,5
mturk_agent_1,"no, I can give you 2 water and one food if you give me 2 firewood",492,5
mturk_agent_2,Ok. Can you give atleast two foods for me😮☹️,492,6
mturk_agent_1,okay. so 2 water and 2 food for you and you will give me 2 firewood,492,6
mturk_agent_2,Ok I agree,492,7

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you doing today?",493,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am doing well, how about you? It is another hot July day.",493,0
mturk_agent_1,I am doing pretty good. I am going camping this weekend and just double checking to see what extra supplies I need,493,1
mturk_agent_2,"I love camping, have not gone in a while. Have you ever camped by a lake?",493,1
mturk_agent_1,Yeah! I usually camp by the lake so I can use the lake water when I need extra water.,493,2
mturk_agent_2,I can understand that. I have done that before. Also done winter camping next to a lake where we tried ice fishing.,493,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like fun. I checked my list and it looks like I am short on firewood however, would you happen to be able to spare some?",493,3
mturk_agent_2,Yeah I could supply you extra firewood. I would like some extra food if you could spare that.,493,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah I could. How about I get 2 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water. And you can have the rest?",493,4
mturk_agent_2,Yeah that sounds resonable. I hope you can have fun on your trip.🙂,493,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,493,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,493,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello there! Excited about your camping trip? 🙂,494,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello , yes I am , going to have lot fun . Are you excited ?",494,0
mturk_agent_2,"I sure am! There's just the little matter of dividing up the remaining resources, but I'm sure we'll be able to come to an arrangement that suits both of us! What would you say are you most important resources for this trip?",494,1
mturk_agent_1,"The food seems to be #1 on my list , if we could find a way to divide this up between us I'd like that a lot 🙂",494,1
mturk_agent_2,😮 Food is #1 for me as well! What a pickle. My #2 is Firewood and my #3 is Water. We can split the Food and divided the Firewood and Food based on how important they are to us.,494,2
mturk_agent_1,"True we can , I'd be willing to just take one of the foods if you'd be willing to do that ? Then we can decide on the others ",494,2
mturk_agent_2,"🙂v it sound's like we're on the right track! I'll gladly take 2 Food. How would you feel about taking all of the Water, while I take all of the Firewood?",494,3
mturk_agent_1,"Not really liking that , but I'd be willing to split the water with you if I could take 2 of those 🙂",494,3
mturk_agent_2,"OK, you take 2 of the Water, and I take 1. That just leaves the Firewood. How about 2 for me and 1 for you?",494,4
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like what I had in mind to do , but let me think a bit more ok ?",494,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,494,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,494,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you doing today?",495,0
mturk_agent_2,Very good. How about you?,495,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm doing well. I'm looking forward to going on my camping trip but will need some additional items to make sure the trip is safe, healthy, and enjoyable. ",495,1
mturk_agent_2,Same here. ,495,1
mturk_agent_1,"I have diabetes, so it is very important to me that I get extra packages of water and food. When I'm at home, I always need to pack extra drinks and snacks for myself in case I go into shock and need to take medication. The trip could be very dangerous for me if I don't have access to these additional supplies. ",495,2
mturk_agent_2,"Actually mine own purposeful need is firewood and water. Being on a first time adventure, I lack these items as I was inadequately prepared.",495,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, so firewood and water are your two most pressing needs?",495,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes.,495,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay. I'm willing to give in on the firewood, but I really can't give in on the water or the food. As a diabetic I have to put my health first. ",495,4
mturk_agent_2,I can give out the food in exchange for the firewood,495,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay. I need all of the water, if you're getting the firewood. ",495,5
mturk_agent_2,I can't give out all the water. I need to be hydrated as well. ,495,5
mturk_agent_1,"You already have all the basics, though, so you won't lack sufficient water to be hydrated. I have a serious medical condition that requires that I have access to additional water. ",495,6
mturk_agent_2,The maximum bundle I can give is all packages of food + 1 package of water,495,6
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, that won't work for me. I've already said that I have a medical condition that requires additional water. You do not need that much water just to be hydrated -- you already have basic water. I can give you all of the firewood, but I need all of the water. ",495,7
mturk_agent_2,In that case I exchange all the water only for all your firewood,495,7
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you all the firewood - but as a diabetic, I still need at least one extra package of food for my blood sugar levels. So, as my final offer I can give you all of the firewood, and two extra packages of food. Do you agree to these terms?",495,8
mturk_agent_2,"No, I give out only one extra package of food",495,8
mturk_agent_1,"I think you misunderstood what I said. I said that *you* would receive all of the firewood, and two extra packages of food. ",495,9
mturk_agent_2,ok,495,9
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, great. It was nice negotiating with you.",495,10
mturk_agent_2,same here,495,10
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,495,11
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,495,11
mturk_agent_2,Hi there.  I'm hoping we can make a deal about me getting firewood.  I get really cold at night and I'd love to have my fire still going in the morning for coffee - I'd gladly share some if you pop by my campsite.,496,0
mturk_agent_1,I am in dire need of firewood myself. I was planning on bringing food that needed to be cooked over flame. 😮,496,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well maybe we can find a way to split it!  This isn't a problem we can't solve.  Are you in need of food too, then?",496,1
mturk_agent_1,"That would be great! I don't need food as much as I am in need of firewood, to be honest.",496,1
mturk_agent_2,I brought purification tablets so I can make do with rainwater or river water.  How about you?,496,2
mturk_agent_1,That's very smart! 🙂 Way to be prepared! I didn't think to do that.,496,2
mturk_agent_2,"So if we were to split the firewood more in your favor and I were to take all the food, and then we kind of split the water, I think we could maybe make a deal here?  🙂",496,3
mturk_agent_1,I think that is definitely doable! I'd be glad to make a deal with you. Thanks for being so reasonable! 🙂🙂,496,3
mturk_agent_2,"So I'm proposing 1 firewood to me, 2 to you.  3 food to me.  And 2 water to me, 1 to you.  Can we work with that?  Firewood seems to be important to the both of us so I'm giving up things here.",496,4
mturk_agent_1,Yes I think that will work just fine. Firewood is important especially because I usually find my food in the woods.,496,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,496,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,496,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I think that my first deal will be fair 🙂",497,0
mturk_agent_1,Well that's interesting because I don't even know what is is.,497,0
mturk_agent_2,We aren't allowed to submit it just yet. So let's chat. What do you value most among the items?,497,1
mturk_agent_1,Please don't try to order me around. 😡 I require a majority of water.,497,1
mturk_agent_2,Let's be reasonable here. If you are nice to me I'll be nice to you. I'll take the majority of the wood and food if you want most water.,497,2
mturk_agent_1,Again don't patronize me.  What is your main focus?,497,2
mturk_agent_2,Please grow up. No one is patronizing you. I'm trying to negotiate. Don't be so emotional okay?,497,3
mturk_agent_1,Grow up. 🙂 This was too easy.  Now please answer the question.,497,3
mturk_agent_2,I just told what I want in exchange for majority of the water. I'll take most of the food and wood. Or else you make out way better than I do.,497,4
mturk_agent_1,That is not what I asked.  Is your main focus water?,497,4
mturk_agent_2,I'm tired of repeating myself. I'll just submit the deal.,497,5
mturk_agent_1,Ok.,497,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,497,6
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,497,6
mturk_agent_1,What is your main focus?,497,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,497,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,497,8
mturk_agent_2,Hey how's it going?,498,0
mturk_agent_1,"Not bad, yourself?",498,0
mturk_agent_2,Pretty good. The kids are looking forward to this weekend's camping trip. ,498,1
mturk_agent_1,"I see, thankfully I do not have any.",498,1
mturk_agent_2,yeah we got a lot of things planned for them at the campgrounds. they're going to be pretty busy,498,2
mturk_agent_1,So what is your main focus this trip?,498,2
mturk_agent_2,one of my kids is on medication so we are going to need to pack a lot of water. so if could spare that it would be appreciated.,498,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well sadly I plan to go hiking a lot so I will need lots of water, but perhaps we can come to a reasonable agreement if I have to shorten my hikes.",498,3
mturk_agent_2,ok what do you have in mind?,498,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well if I gave you a majority of the water, I would like 1 water, 3 firewood and 1 food.",498,4
mturk_agent_2,"so I would have 2 water, 2 food and 1 firewood? My kids were looking forward to making s'mores. If I could get 2 water, 2 firewood and one food, that would be great!",498,5
mturk_agent_1,"You would get 2 water and 2 food, I would get 1 water and 1 food for hiking and 3 firewood for having to stay out longer in the dark to complete my hiking goals.",498,5
mturk_agent_2,doesn't really seem fair for you to get all the firewood. I would like to have at least one because then we're completely in the dark.,498,6
mturk_agent_1,"You get lots of water and food for your children, I am cutting back on my goals by giving up energy which means I have spend more time outside hiking.  I do need to stay warm",498,6
mturk_agent_2,yes which is why you have two firewood. I think it is fair for me to get at least one. If food is so important to you then I'll give you two food. but we would be in the dark,498,7
mturk_agent_1,I suppose that's fair enough.,498,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,498,8
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,498,8
mturk_agent_1,Hello 🙂What would you like to do with this deal?,499,0
mturk_agent_2,"My friend ended up having a medical emergency and couldn't go to the store when I asked her to get food. Because of that, I would like 3 food packages. I had to go help her with the medical forms and didn't have time to shop",499,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes I can give you the three food but I need 2 water. I can become very thirsty. ,499,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes that is totally fine with me. What about firewood,499,1
mturk_agent_1,I can give you 1 of the firewood. I would like to stay warm at night so I want 2. 😮,499,2
mturk_agent_2,Hmm that's going to be hard for me because I also get cold. what other reasons do you have?,499,2
mturk_agent_1,I like to have a big fire so that I can feel good at night. I can get lonely at night. ☹️,499,3
mturk_agent_2,aww that's sad! I think I can do that then. ,499,3
mturk_agent_1,Thank you so much. Do you have any things you might need?,499,4
mturk_agent_2,"I think having 3 food, 1 firewood, and 1 water like we have discussed is what I need. You can have the rest. ",499,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,499,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,499,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, what are your preferences for extra supplies?  I am greatly in need of food and water.  We will be doing a lot of activity in a hot, dry climate.🙂",5,0
mturk_agent_2,I prefer firewood because I will get cold at night. I forgot blankets ☹️,5,0
mturk_agent_1,"Would it work for you, then, to give me the three food and three water, and I can give you all of the firewood?",5,1
mturk_agent_2,No. Because I brought a water purifier but don't plan on hunting or fishing. So I'd be willing to give up all the water but I want 2 of the food.,5,1
mturk_agent_1,"I see.  I also greatly need the extra food, as I indicated. Perhaps there are some convenience or grocery stores near your campground--you might then purchase extra food there and not have to carry it with you on your trip?  ",5,2
mturk_agent_2,"I believe there won't be any convenience stores around to buy food, And I plan on staying out longer than you so I will need more food to last me, Do you need food or water more?",5,2
mturk_agent_1,"How do you know you are staying longer than me? I haven't even said how long I am staying! I am also with a big group.  ☹️☹️  I need food the most, and I would like to take at least 2 extra waters.  I could possibly give up one of the food packages if you could part with 2 firewood.  Without extra food, I would have to do some fishing and cook the fish.",5,3
mturk_agent_2,"No. I won't part with any firewood because I can't stand being cold, and you can have 2 foods if you have a larger group if you give me 1 water. 🙂🙂",5,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, that's not going to work for me.  ☹️ You have a water purifier? Doesn't sound like extra water is necessary.  I am in a hot, dry climate.  I can give up all the firewood to you, if you can leave me the three packages of food.  I would also like 2 waters.  ",5,4
mturk_agent_2,Sorry but I'm willing to give up all the water for 1 food at least. I already mentioned above that I don't plan on hunting or fishing and I plan on being out for a while. That's my final offer.,5,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I will leave you all the firewood and 1 food, and I will take two food and three water packages. I am willing to finalize that.☹️",5,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,5,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,5,6

mturk_agent_2,"How about I take 1 food, 2 firewood and 2 water",50,1
mturk_agent_1,I am okay with that deal. What items do you give me?,50,2
mturk_agent_2,"You get 2 food, 1 firewood and 1 water",50,2
mturk_agent_1,I am okay with that deal. What is your opinion?,50,3

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,50,5
mturk_agent_1,"It's been so cold these last few days, I'm worried that I didn't bring enough wood for the next few nights.",500,0
mturk_agent_2,That is unfortunate. How about I give you are my firewood for all your food?,500,0
mturk_agent_1,That is a very generous offer but I think I need to keep some food to be safe. Do you need any water?,500,1
mturk_agent_2,"I can use water, yes. You could have all the firewood, one food ration. Then I could take the water rations and two food rations. ",500,1
mturk_agent_1,"Actually, I'd like to keep some water as well in case it gets so cold that the lakes and other water sources freeze.",500,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I need as much food as possible. You seem to want firewood. How about you suggest something.",500,2
mturk_agent_1,"That's a good idea.Let me think. How about 3 Firewood, 1 Food and 2 waters for me.",500,3
mturk_agent_2,That will not work for me at all. ,500,3
mturk_agent_1,"I see. Then how does 2 Firewood, 1 food and 1 water for me sound? You'll be getting 1, Wood 2 Foods and 1 Water",500,4
mturk_agent_2,"Your calculations are incorrect. There are 3 firewood, 3 food, and 3 water. You are missing a water. I will return to my original offer since you need firewood the most and I need food the most. I take all the food, you take all the wood. And then you can take 1 water as you just suggested. ",500,4
mturk_agent_1,That will work fine with me. Please enjoy your food and two waters.,500,5
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you, you as well. ",500,5

mturk_agent_2,That's great! I also have a comping trip planned. We will be having an all night dance party. I could definitely use some extra supplies. What are you in need of the most?,502,1
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like fun. I am pretty good at hunting and fishing, so I really don't need the extra food. I would like some extra firewood however. That would help cook the food and keep animals and insects away at night",502,2
mturk_agent_2,Ugh ☹️ I too could really use the firewood. We need that campfire going all night to be able to socialize. How about water? Do you have enough? Do you need more?,502,2
mturk_agent_1,I have an idea. I could give you 3 firewood and you give me 3 water and 3 food. ,502,3
mturk_agent_2,That would be great but I could find myself in need of some extra water. Don't want t get dehydrated from all the dancing! Could I trade you one of the firewood for 2 of the water?,502,3
mturk_agent_1,I see. How about you get 2 firewood 1 water 1 food. And I get 1 firewod 2 water 2 food?,502,4
mturk_agent_2,"I think that sounds fair. So I would get 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food. You could get 1 firewood, 2 water, 2 food. Is that correct?",502,4

mturk_agent_2,"I'm excited to go on it! I haven't gone it yet, that's why we're talking about supplies now.",503,1

mturk_agent_1,"awesome! I love the rockies. So let's try and divy up our extra supplies then. Personally, I feel that I'd need the most extra food, as I'm a rather large guy and plan to go hiking a lot during this time. Firewood would be nice, so I could have a big bonfire. What are your prefernces? ",504,1
mturk_agent_2,i need food the most since there will be my kids and I. I can give up my firewood for food,504,2

mturk_agent_1,"food, then water, then firewood, and yours?",505,2
mturk_agent_2,"water, food then firewood. It's really hot so I need to make sure we are hydrated. We forgot a bag of supplies that had mostly food so we really could use food. It's hot so firewood isn't necessary. If anything we can get it from around or on a hike.",505,2
mturk_agent_1,"of course, we should help one another, we will figure something out i'm sure",505,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I think we can. I'm thinking 3 water, 2 food and 1 firewood for myself? How does that sound to you?",505,3
mturk_agent_1,"i can't agree to that, the best i can do is 2water 1 food and 2 firewood for you, i have to have supplies too",505,4
mturk_agent_2,Could I trade one firewood for another food?,505,4

mturk_agent_2,That works for me.🙂 Are you able to share the food if I give you 1 firewood?,506,3

mturk_agent_1,I am doing okay but am in need of some supplies. What about you?,507,1
mturk_agent_2,Same here. My kids are really looking forward to this. What is most important to you?,507,1
mturk_agent_1,Firewood! I need it to cook my food and also to stay warm. What about you?,507,2
mturk_agent_2,That is the same for me as well. My kids were really looking forward to making s'mores and telling stories by the campfire. That's all they've been talking about,507,2
mturk_agent_1,"Awesome, I'd be happy to negotiate that. What is your second most needed item?",507,3
mturk_agent_2,I'll need water. My kids take medications and need to stay hydrated.,507,3
mturk_agent_1,Absolutely. My second most needed item is food so that works out well.,507,4
mturk_agent_2,Well I am happy to give you all my food in exchange for all your water.,507,4
mturk_agent_1,We can do that! How do you want to split up the firewood?,507,5
mturk_agent_2,It's an odd number so someone has to get 2. But in order to make it fair if one of us takes two then the other should get one of the lower priority items. What do you think?,507,5
mturk_agent_1,That sounds fair to me! I am good either way.,507,6
mturk_agent_2,That's very nice of you. If it is ok with you them I'll take two firewood and 2 water and you can have the rest.,507,6

mturk_agent_1,I don't need the water as much.  How about I get 2 firewood and you get 2 water?,508,1
mturk_agent_2,I would prefer all the water. You can have all of the firewood.,508,1
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me.  What about the food?,508,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would like 2 food, but you may have one. I wouldn't want you to be too hungry!",508,2
mturk_agent_1,I don't want to be too hungry either but I think perhaps I might need an extra water to compensate for the lack of food.,508,3
mturk_agent_2,"Since I am giving you all of the firewood that you said was most important to you, I feel I should get at least the same amount of items as you, especially since you are getting exactly the firewood you want. I will need to stick to three waters and two food.",508,3
mturk_agent_1,"The firewood is most important to me to be sure. However, if you get more food and all of the water I could end up going hungry.☹️",508,4
mturk_agent_2,Well I would be happy to exchange you one of your firewood for the one water you need. That way you won't go thirsty.,508,4

mturk_agent_1,"Wow, ok. I'd can give you some food, I'd like to have a little extra food and water as we have a larger group going. ",509,1
mturk_agent_2,"I see. Which is more important to you, food or water?",509,1
mturk_agent_1,"If I had my choice, I'd say I'd rather have more food.",509,2
mturk_agent_2,Interesting. Looks like we are in the same situation! 😮,509,2
mturk_agent_1,"I'd be willing to give you extra food if I could then get extra water and firewood. How about you Get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood?",509,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds almost fair. But I could possibly use 1 more firewood. What do you think?🙂🙂,509,3
mturk_agent_1,"Idk, you're already getting the extra food which would be important to me. I think my offer is very fair for both of us.",509,4
mturk_agent_2,"I'm not sure either. Well them, how about we switch and you can have 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood and I will take the rest. The homeless could use water almost as much as food",509,4
mturk_agent_1,"sure, i can agree to that",509,5

mturk_agent_1,I am too! I have a rather large family and we are looking forward to getting out for some time away!,51,1
mturk_agent_2,How nice. I am bringing my daughter and her girl scout troop. I am the co leader.,51,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh that,51,2
mturk_agent_2,We will need some extra water for all the girls on the hike.,51,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, I sent my last message inadvertently. I meant to say that that sounds great! Yes, I can understand the need for extra water for the hike. With the size of my family, I could use a bit of extra food for our trip.",51,3
mturk_agent_2,We can get by with less food since the girls will be looking to forage in the forest to get a badge.,51,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's awesome! Since we have the basics, would you be willing to swap 3 packages of food for 3 packages of water?",51,4
mturk_agent_2,"We will need two food so we can fill their bellies, but I will be glad to offer you all the firewood since I can use my axe and get wood for us.",51,4
mturk_agent_1,"Absolutely understand. How does this deal sound: you will get 2 food, I will get 1. You will get 3 water, I will get 0. You will get 0 firewood, I will get 3.",51,5
mturk_agent_2,That is a very fair deal. I am glad we could work this out.,51,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,51,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,51,6
mturk_agent_1,I have a big party with varying degrees of health and I'm going to need every bit of firewood and food I can get my hands on!  🙂,510,0
mturk_agent_2,"hi, we may be in luck then, i really would like water as i enjoy walking and hiking, i will require some firewood though so i can roast some s'mores",510,0
mturk_agent_1,How many people are in your camping party?,510,1
mturk_agent_2,"i have 6, and 2 more could be joining us to make 8 ",510,1
mturk_agent_1,"Cool! 🙂  It's a good number, we are planning on 10, but you never know on these.  What I do know is this group loves to eat and hike, plus it might get a little chilly.",510,2
mturk_agent_2,"yeah, i understand that. we are all apart of a weigh watchers group ao we",510,2
mturk_agent_1,😮 Been there and done that.  It's great when you can start to see the change in their self esteem!,510,3
mturk_agent_2,"yes, for sure starting to see results, id be more than happy if i could get two or three waters and at least one or two firewood ",510,3
mturk_agent_1,"I can definitely oblige on the water as we are lucky enough to have a spot that is just by the lake.  Makes for a cold night, but all the fresh water and fish you can handle!",510,4
mturk_agent_2,"yea, i love some blue gill! ",510,4
mturk_agent_1,"How do you feel about this?  You get three water, I get three food, and then you take one firewood while I take the other two?",510,5
mturk_agent_2,that will work out wonderfully since you have the bigger party anyways ,510,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,510,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,510,6
mturk_agent_1,"I'm thinking I'l get 2 firewood, and 2 water and 1 food. I'm not sure what you need, but we can figure it out. ",511,0
mturk_agent_2,"my highest priority is water, i need it to stay hydrated from the camping beers",511,0
mturk_agent_1,Who doesn't? I need more wood. I'm skinny. I get cold easily. Beer hidrates dude 🙂,511,1
mturk_agent_2,"ha no prob on the wood, its out there in nature so i can do with less of it hows 3 water, 1 food, 0 wood sound",511,1
mturk_agent_1,I'll need at least one water dude. I don't have any beer. 🙂,511,2
mturk_agent_2,"were getting closer - id do 2 water, 2 food, 1 wood",511,2
mturk_agent_1,I don't know. You are geting more items. That's greed bro :-),511,3
mturk_agent_2,I just want to make sure you are getting extra of the items you really need like firewood🙂,511,3
mturk_agent_1,It's not like I don't need foor. I have two teenagers. Do you know how much they eat?,511,4
mturk_agent_2,"I agree, have a young one myself. But not two! Lets close this out at 2 waters, 1 firewood, 1 food for me.",511,4
mturk_agent_1,"I'll submit then Fire-2, Water-1, Food- 2",511,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,511,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,511,6
mturk_agent_2,Hi there - how are you today?,512,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm doing well.  How are you today?,512,0
mturk_agent_2,Pretty good. Just hanging out with our group. Looking forward to this upcoming camping trip. It's a college reunion weekend. ,512,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh.  That sounds fun.  I'm getting ready to go camping with my family next weekend as well.  It will be the first time that my kids have gone camping with me.,512,1
mturk_agent_2,Aw that will be a great time then 🙂 How old are your kids? ,512,2
mturk_agent_1,"My kids are 14 and 12.  So they're fairly independent - but I also know that they want to do a lot of cooking during our camping trip.  Thus, I think that I'm going to need more firewood as I expect that we'll be having a lot of fires while we're out.  How about you?  What are you planning to do on your camping trip?",512,2
mturk_agent_2,"Good ages. They should be able to help out. We're planning to do a big bonfire, maybe some smores, and hopefully find a lake. We're looking for extra firewood and water for the bonfire and to keep hydrated",512,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds like a blast.   I would like to propose that you take 2 waters and 1 firewood and I'll take 2 firewoods and 1 water for our respective trips.  Does that work for you?,512,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, we are all looking forward to it. Thanks for being amenable and trying to make this work. That might be okay, but could we take take the 3 packages of food? Since we won't be doing as big of a bonfire, I am sure we'll hike more or swim and need the extra energy",512,4
mturk_agent_1,"I was hoping to take at least some of the food with me.  As you know, those teenagers seem to hungry ALL the time.  It's like feeding fuel into a bottomless pit.  So I'm definitely going to need some of the food for my trip as well.",512,4
mturk_agent_2,Hm okay. Would 1 packet of food be sufficient? I know they are growing but my friends are ex football players and can eat 3x the normal person,512,5
mturk_agent_1,"Those ex-football players can eat way more than the average person.  I would be OK with that deal.  I will get 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food.  You'll get 1 firewood, 2 water and 2 food.  I'll go ahead and submit this deal for you to agree to.  Thanks for negotiating and have a great camping trip!",512,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,512,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,512,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello I'm really hungry and thirsty and want some food and water if that's ok with you. ,513,0
mturk_agent_1,Well some is okay but not all. The thing is that we left in a hurry and forgot to pick up the bag with the extra food items. I am sorry but we have kids with us so we will need the food. Am sure you understand ☹️,513,0
mturk_agent_2,Fair enough I understand that you have hungry kids. If I give you the majority of food can I get a majority of the other two items?,513,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, what if I take all food and 1 water and you take the rest. Will that work for you? we do have enough firewood.",513,1
mturk_agent_2,No I was thinking I would get all the waters and you get 1 firewood or I get one food 2 waters and 2 firewood. ,513,2
mturk_agent_1,We packed enough water but the kids spilled some so I just wanted to make sure we have additional water in case we run out. But we can do with only 1 water. We do really need the food though ☹️,513,2
mturk_agent_2,So do I. I'm trying to bulk up because I've been skinny all my life. ☹️ Let me just get one please☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️,513,3
mturk_agent_1,"well we do not want to be unreasonable. How about we take 2 food, 2 water then just in case they can be satisfied with the extra water. In that case you get 1 food, 1 water and all firewood. ",513,3
mturk_agent_2,That is not too fair neither of us need firewood. It would be most fair if you got two of your biggest need and I got two of the others. ,513,4
mturk_agent_1,"so you do not need the firewood at all? in that case i can take 2 food, 1 water and 2 firewood. You can take 1 food,2 waters and 1 firewood. ",513,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,513,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,513,5
mturk_agent_2,hi there🙂,514,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello. How are you today? 🙂,514,0
mturk_agent_2,Pretty good!  I am looking forward to going on this camping trip with my family.,514,1
mturk_agent_1,"Same here! We had a couple bumps in the road though, as our freezer stopped working so all our food went bad ☹️",514,1
mturk_agent_2,That is rough ☹️  We should try to split the resources equitably then,514,2
mturk_agent_1,Ya definitely. I need food and firewood most. What do you need?,514,2
mturk_agent_2,"I believe that we have the same priorities.  So we have a large family including children that need the food, but my wife also needs firewood due to poor circulation.  She is susceptible to frost bite and limb loss",514,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay so how about one of us takes 2 of the food and 1 of the firewood, and the other takes 1 of the food and 2 of the firewood?",514,3
mturk_agent_2,"that sounds fair.  I will take 1 food, 2 firewood, and 2 water, thus giving you 2 food, 1 firewood, 1 water",514,4
mturk_agent_1,Okay that works for me,514,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,514,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,514,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello,515,0
mturk_agent_1,"hello, so what is your most important thing that you want? ",515,0
mturk_agent_2,my priority is firewood. What's yours?,515,1
mturk_agent_1,me and my gals thing that firewood is important also but we actually want water,515,1
mturk_agent_2,We can figure something out. Would you rather have 3 water and 0 firewood or 2 water and 1 firewood?,515,2
mturk_agent_1,can i have 2 foods too,515,2
mturk_agent_2,If I can have all the firewood...,515,3
mturk_agent_1,i am giving you one firewood,515,3
mturk_agent_2,That doesn't work for me. I propose you get 2 water and one firewood and 2 food.,515,4
mturk_agent_1,"so you would get 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food",515,4
mturk_agent_2,yes,515,5

mturk_agent_1,no i need firewood to always keep myself warm.,516,0
mturk_agent_2,"So do I, I have health issues.  I can give you one firewood, if I get all the food. ",516,1
mturk_agent_1,why can't i get 2 firewoods?.......i'm an ulcer patient i need more than enough food to keep fit',516,1
mturk_agent_2,"It will be a strain, but I can give you 2 firewood if I get all the food and two water.",516,2
mturk_agent_1,"No that food is very much important to me......i'll get 2 food,2 firewood and 1 water",516,2
mturk_agent_2,"With little firewood, I need the food since I can't cook fish.  How about you get 2 firewood, one food, and 1 water?",516,3
mturk_agent_1,how about i get 2food because it is very important to my health,516,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, how about you get 2 firewood, 2 food, and I get 1 firewood and 1 food and all the water?",516,4
mturk_agent_1,"☹️ no i also need water,i get dehydrated easily",516,4
mturk_agent_2,"So do I, especially since I'm doing a lot of hiking.",516,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,516,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,516,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi there! I was looking for 3 extra packages of food and 3 packages of firewood.,517,0
mturk_agent_2,We can work a deal out. How's your day? 🙂,517,0
mturk_agent_1,"It's good, thank you 🙂 Which package is the most important for you to have on your trip do you think?",517,1
mturk_agent_2,"That would be firewood. Even though is really hot there, it gets cold at night. How's the weather for you? 🙂",517,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ah yes, you'll definitely need some extra wood then! It's also pretty cold here, especially during the night. But I would definitely be willing to let you take 2 firewood in exchange for 3 food. We have a lot of people going and will be out in the middle of nowhere.",517,2
mturk_agent_2,We can definitely work something out. I'll be sure it'll benefit you more than me. 🙂,517,2
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, well that's really nice of you. What do you propose?",517,3
mturk_agent_2,"You'll get 3 food and 2 water, and I'll take 3 firewood and 1 water. 🙂",517,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, I think that could definitely work! Appreciate it 🙂",517,4
mturk_agent_2,Sound great 🙂,517,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,517,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,517,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you?",518,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! I'm doing well, hope you are too 🙂 ",518,0
mturk_agent_2,I am!  So are you going camping as well?,518,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes! I've been looking forward to this trip for a while and I'm so excited,518,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah me too, so apparently there are some extra supplies up for grabs we need to divvy up between us.  Do you have any thoughts on how we should do that?",518,2
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking we can say which ones we want more? Or depending on where we are camping and our camping abilities, we might need some materials more over others",518,2
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds good to me!  I heard where we are going it is going to be really cold the next couple of nights so we definitely need extra firewood.  We also have a pretty big group so extra food and water would come in handy too.  So how about I take 2 of the extra firewood, 1 extra water and 2 extra food?",518,3
mturk_agent_1,"Oh we have a substantial group as well, one of which is newly pregnant. Since we could find firewood ourselves, how about you take 2 firewood, 1 water, 1 food? ",518,3
mturk_agent_2,"We could really use that extra water and food, maybe you would be interested a little bit more firewood?  How about I take 1 firewood, 2 water, and 2 food?  I've got a big group of guys to feed.",518,4
mturk_agent_1,"I completely understand 🙂 However, my group won't really need the firewood much. We'd need the food more since we have some kids with us and the fathers are like lumberjacks haha. 2 firewood, 1 water, 1 food would work best",518,4
mturk_agent_2,I suppose that seems pretty fair to me.  You have a deal!,518,5

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,518,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello,519,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi can I ask what camping supplies you most need?,519,0
mturk_agent_2,I would like the 3 food packages because my sister forgot to pack any food items for the trip. You can have all the water and firewood. ,519,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh no!  I have my daughter with me and she really likes to eat.  I was hoping to get at least some of the food.  Do you need water or firewood more?,519,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'm sure we can come to some compromise. I know my sister and I want to make s'mores in the evening. How about I get 2 food and 1 firewood, 1 water and you get the rest? ",519,2
mturk_agent_1,I love s'mores.  Food is my number one concern though.  If I'm only getting 1 of the food I really need all of the water.  How does that sound?,519,2
mturk_agent_2,So I get only 3 packages? 2 food and 1 firewood? ,519,3
mturk_agent_1,Do you need more firewood?  I could compromise there.,519,3
mturk_agent_2,How about I get 2 food and 2 firewood? You can get all the water plus 1 food and 1 firewood? ,519,4

mturk_agent_1,Tell me about it!  With this pandemic it seems like all days are Mondays 🙂,52,1
mturk_agent_2,"Too true! Anyways, what is the item that you prefer the most for this camping adventure? 🙂",52,2
mturk_agent_1,"Firewood, how about you?",52,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, firewood as well! It's not a camping trip if you run out of firewood in just a few nights! I would hate to be cold ",52,3
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking S’mores!  I will start off....2 firewood, 2 water, 1 food",52,3
mturk_agent_2,"I was thinking smores too! Well I can settle for 1 firewood, but I think I would need more food to keep busy. How about (for me to recieve): 1 firewood, 3 food, 1 water?",52,4
mturk_agent_1,"I can go for that, so I would get 2 firewood, 0 food and 2 water",52,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,52,5

mturk_agent_1,"yes please,  i  dont require much food or water 🙂",520,1
mturk_agent_2,"🙂  You're being very accommodating! So right now I have 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood. And you have 1 food, 1 water and 2 firewood, right?",520,2
mturk_agent_1,"that sounds good to me, if you want to give me another food i would take it but ok if not ",520,2
mturk_agent_2,I wish we could split packages in two!  How about if I give you another food and I keep two firewood?,520,3
mturk_agent_1,"that is ok, the original you stated will work, 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood for you, and 2 firewood, 1 food and 1 water for me , i need to lose weight anyways ",520,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well now that you mention it, I could lose a few pounds 😮",520,4
mturk_agent_1,"haha but you enjoy hiking, i do not. ",520,4
mturk_agent_2,"That's true! Okay, 2 let's go with 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood for me and you can have 1 food, 1 water and 2 firewood. And since we are camping near each other, if you need anything, just ask! 🙂",520,5

mturk_agent_1,"I could give you 2 food, if I could have 3 firewood and 2 water",525,1
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, how about I take 2 food and 2 water and you can have all the firewood?",525,2

mturk_agent_2,"Hmm ☹️.  How about 1 food, 3 water and 2 firewood?",525,3
mturk_agent_1,"I could give you 3 firewood, 2 water, but that is the most I could do",525,3

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I would really like to get most of the water and firewood packages.",526,0
mturk_agent_1,You can have most of the water and firewood if I can have most of the food. I would like to get two of the firewood so I have a nice fire to come back to after searching for a source of water.,526,0
mturk_agent_2,"How about I take all off the water, 1 firewood and 1 food package? 🙂",526,1
mturk_agent_1,You can have all of the water if I can have all of the food. I promise that I will bring you back food. I am really good at foraging and I know all about what is edible in a forest 🙂 I want to have two packages of firewood so that I can have a roaring and hot fire going when I come back from being out all day. I am sure that I will find some fish to catch at my water source! 🙂 I'll bring some to back to share with you!,526,1
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you, I would appreciate that and it is very generous of you, Im not a strong hunter or fisher at all :) ",526,2
mturk_agent_1,"Awesome! I think we have a deal! So just to clarify, I will have all the extra food so that I can have strength to forage, you will have all the water, and I will have 2 firewoods so I can have a hot fire for our catch of the day! Are you happy with this, friend? 🙂",526,2
mturk_agent_2,"I do agree with that, I am happy with all of the extra water, and I should be able to get more firewood pretty easily, and since you will be sharing whatever food you find, I think that we came up with a pretty fair split.",526,3
mturk_agent_1,It's always lovely to have a camping companion you can cooperate with! ,526,3
mturk_agent_2,I completely agree and i am glad that we could work together and compromise.,526,4
mturk_agent_1,"Absolutely! I am sure we will be able to find a good spot with some firewood around! I always bring my axe, so I will let you borrow it to chop wood around camp. This is also a great season for mushrooms to be growing! That would make a great side dish to the fish! I love sauteeing them over a hot fire! 🙂",526,4

mturk_agent_1,I am well; I love going camping. I really enjoyed my time in Boy Scouts and look forward to practicing what I learned to good use,527,1
mturk_agent_2,That is awesome. I brought extra firewood if you need some. My brother forgot to pick up the water when he left town and now is 15 mins away. Do you have any you give?🙂🙂,527,1
mturk_agent_1,I would love some extra firewood; however I need some extra food too. I have diabetes and it's important that I have more food for later,527,2
mturk_agent_2,O wow.☹️ I'm sorry to here that. I can give you all my firewood and a food if you can give me all your water. ,527,2

mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I would like to get 2 additional packages of food, 2 additional jugs of water, and 1 additional bundle of firewood. I need the additional food because I will have 3 children with me on the trip and one of those being a baby. The baby needs water for her bottles and I need an additional bundle of firewood to warm her bottles.",528,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I appreciate your response. I would like to compromise. I will give you the bundle of firewood you requested as well as the 2 packages of food. However, I would like to get 2 jugs of water. I have 2 other adults with me on this trip and they require more water to stay hydrated than a baby would.",528,0
mturk_agent_1,That actually sounds pretty good to me. 🙂,528,1
mturk_agent_2,🙂,528,1
mturk_agent_1,"So, it looks like we have reached a compromise. ",528,2

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I was hoping we can chat. ",529,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi there. ,529,0
mturk_agent_2,So why did you decide to come camping?🙂,529,1
mturk_agent_1,I think it will be fun. I was wondering what your preferences are for the extra items we can bring?,529,1
mturk_agent_2,I was hoping for food as I forgot a bag at of stuff at home. I also was hoping to star gaze but I may not have enough wood to keep warm.,529,2
mturk_agent_1,I understand. I too would really like some food because I would get pretty hungry without it and I also forgot to bring some. Firewood is so important for keeping warm. There are three of each item. Maybe we can negotiate on how to split the resources,529,2
mturk_agent_2,I don't need any water and I did bring a small amount of food. How about you take 2 food and 1 firewood.and 2 water,529,3
mturk_agent_1,I really could use a little more firewood. Thank you for the water. That is very helpful. I am just worried I will not have enough wood to boil it. ,529,3
mturk_agent_2,I think i can give 1 more fire wood.🙂,529,4
mturk_agent_1,"So, that would be 2 firewood, 2 food and 2 water for me and one of each to you? Thank you ",529,4
mturk_agent_2,I would really like to come out of this with a bit more. How about 2 food for me and 1 firewood and water?,529,5
mturk_agent_1,What are your current requirements on food so I can better understand your situation?,529,5
mturk_agent_2,☹️ I forgot most the food I was going to bring and only have enough for less than half the planned trip.,529,6
mturk_agent_1,I understand. I guess we are in the same predicament. I have two kids with me though and they are hungry too. How long are you camping for? We are here a week.,529,6
mturk_agent_2,I let my two girls bring their friend. Its their first overnight trip for more than a night. We also had a week planned.,529,7
mturk_agent_1,My kids really eat a lot. But then yours probably to as well!,529,7
mturk_agent_2,Can we agree on 2 food for me and 1 water and firewood,529,8
mturk_agent_1,How about if I give you 2 water and I take the 2 food?,529,8
mturk_agent_2,I don't need water I have plenty of water. You said you needed wood to boil the waters. So I offered more wood.,529,9
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, how about this. I understand that you have more kids than me and there are only limited resources. Let's agree that you get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood",529,9
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,529,10
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,529,10
mturk_agent_2,how about I give you 2 waters and 1 food package in exchange for all your firewood?,53,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm afraid that will not work for me. I have hypothyroidism, so I am intolerant to cold temperatures. I was also planning on taking a swim in the river. I would prefer to take two firewood & one food package, & you may have the three waters, two food packages, & one firewood.",53,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm afraid I also have need of the firewood. I have anaemia so i get cold easily so I need to make sure I have adequate firewood or i may freeze at night. I also have a thin clothing so they wont provide adequate warmth. How about all of my water and 2 food for all of the firewood?,53,1
mturk_agent_1,"Seeing as we both have a medical-necessity for the firewood, it's rather unfair that either one of us take ALL of the firewood. I felt that I was being rather generous with my previous offer.",53,1
mturk_agent_2,"you are right we both need the wood, how about i give 1 wood, all of my water and 2 food and you give 2 wood and 1 food?",53,2
mturk_agent_1,"Where are you camping? Perhaps we can compromise by having our tents nearby each other, which would be like we each get three firewood? I am not willing to trade my package of marshmallows, though.",53,2
mturk_agent_2,"i hope we can come to a compromise 🙂, what is another priority of yours besides the wood?",53,3
mturk_agent_1,"Food is a second priority for me, as I will be metal-detecting as well, & cannot risk fainting from the heat. How about I give you two firewood (I don't think we can ""share"", haha), you can give me two food packages, and two water packages.",53,3
mturk_agent_2,"okay, I am willing to give up more food to get the firewood, I like your offer🙂",53,4
mturk_agent_1,I do as well. I'm glad we could come to an agreement! 🙂,53,4

mturk_agent_2,"Well, To be honest I plan to take the boys hiking. It's a long walk so we will need to stay hydrated. So water has to be (2) Firewood is definitely important to us, but I'm not sure we can get by on just (1) food",530,2
mturk_agent_1,"then you can get 2 food, 1 water and 2 firewoods ",530,2
mturk_agent_2,After talking it over the boys I think with can go with 2 water 1 food and 2 firewood🙂,530,3

mturk_agent_1,Yeah same here. The kids are really looking forward to it.,531,1
mturk_agent_2,"Same, my kids are as well! They have not been camping before. They are super excited about the campfires. I'm worried I don't have near enough firewood though. I just found out you can't cut any trees down where we are staying. ",531,1
mturk_agent_1,oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. My kid are looking forward to the ghost stories around the campfire.,531,2
mturk_agent_2,My kids will enjoy that as well. I'm hoping I can pack several extra things of firewood. If I could get 3 more packages I would feel better about having enough firewood to have campfires during the evening and to cook on. ,531,2
mturk_agent_1,ok I completely understand. I am more than happy to offer you 3 firewood in exchange for 3 food. If you are ok with splitting 2 water for me and 1 for you that works well. My kids need food and water for their medications.,531,3
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm I will consider it. I'm worried about not having enough food for my kids. They seem to be on a growing spurt and get very frustrated quickly when they are hungry. I would be will to negotiate it I can get 3 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water. ",531,3
mturk_agent_1,"Food is very important to me probably as much as firewood is to you. If we can stick with the 3 food, 0 firewood and 2 water that would be great. ",531,4

mturk_agent_2,Do you bring enough stuff?,532,1
mturk_agent_1,"I have some stuff, but I really need a decent amount of firewood. Gets really cold at night where we camp",532,2
mturk_agent_2,I am fine with the cold although I might need some to set up the fire. I have a baby with me so I might need to heat up the milk or food. ,532,2
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, I see. How about 2 firewood for you and 2 food. I keep the rest",532,3
mturk_agent_2,I don't really need food. I can do it with 1 firewood so you can get the rest. But I really need water. We are going hiking and drink a lot.,532,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, would you do 1 firewood, 2 water and 1 food then?",532,4
mturk_agent_2,Can I get 3 water and 1 firewood instead?,532,4

mturk_agent_2,Hi! I'm super excited to go camping with my family as a great way to vacation due to Covid19. My kid is so restless from being cooped up in the house all the time. Are you planning on going camping too?,533,0
mturk_agent_1,"I am! It is the perfect way to get away and still manage to social distance! I am worried about having enough water though, are you short on any supplies?",533,0
mturk_agent_2,"I think I'm good. I'm not 100% sure. My husband likes to do adventures on the fly. He got these water filter straw thingies from Amazon and said that if we run out of the water I packed, that we can drink the water in the lake but I don't really trust the straws.",533,1
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds like you need water too. How about you take 2 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood?",533,1
mturk_agent_2,"I don't know, you said you're worried about having enough water too. I'm excited to make campfires though! My kid hasn't had a campfire smore yet so I'm super excited to see his face of joy when he experiences it.",533,2
mturk_agent_1,"I am worried about water but also could use a little more food, just in case. I am looking forward to a nice campfire as well!",533,2

mturk_agent_1,"We will be camping up north, nothing around for miles!",533,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ooh, that sounds like you're really roughing it! What kind of activities do you plan to do? I'm planning to really tire my kid out and do a lot of hiking. My husband's also excited to practice ""survival skills"" and wants to do a lot of fishing and foraging too.",533,4
mturk_agent_1,"We will be going with my sons, we are going to be doing a lot of fishing if weather permits! Practicing survival skills sounds fun, and useful! How would you like to split the extra supplies?",533,4

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,533,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! And happy camping! 🙂 To start off, I am thinking that I will need at least 3 firewood, 2 water and 1 food. Last time my axe broke and we ran out of wood! What do you think/need?",534,0
mturk_agent_1,I also was really needing some firewood. It's supposed to get pretty cold at night where we are camping and I need to make sure I can keep my kids warm.,534,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm.. well let's see! What is your second priority? I would be willing to give up all of that, if I could get at least 2 firewood. You're right, it sure does get chilly ☹️",534,1
mturk_agent_1,What if I got 3 foods and 2 waters. and you got 3 firewood and 1 water. If I could get a little more food that doesn't need to be cooked over the fire I might be able to get by. And I'll need to buy more water so I don't have to boil it since I won't have much firewood. ,534,1
mturk_agent_2,"I would say that sounds like a good deal! I am a little worried about water though, there aren't any sources of water where we are going. Hmm..",534,2
mturk_agent_1,I think having 3 packages of firewood will help! you can always boil water from a  fresh spring 🙂,534,2
mturk_agent_2,"That's true! Thank you so much for the advice, I am definitely new to this camping thing 🙂 Well I think 3 foods, 2 waters for you sounds like a good deal. Firewood will definitely be needed on our trip! 🙂",534,3

mturk_agent_2,I agree!  I will say it has really sparked my interest in camping and being outdoors even more though! I saw just how connected I was to technology and everything else!,535,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm up here to do some cross training and noticed that there is some extra water around. Even though the nights are cold I could use some extra water. Do you exercise much?,535,1
mturk_agent_2,It has been extremely dry in the area I will be going to so I was hoping to get a little extra water too.  I do. I love hiking and running trails!  Due to the extreme dry weather I should have plenty of wood I can scavenge for if you need all of it!,535,2
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm. Maybe we could go out together on a run. 🙂Always nice to have a running partner. So maybe on the water you get 2, me 1. Then on the Firewood the opposite?",535,2
mturk_agent_2,That would be fun! I feel like I always do better when I have someone to run against.  Competition does me good. That sounds fantastic on the fire wood and water split.  What is your food situation looking like??,535,3
mturk_agent_1,How about this? 2 for you and 1 for me. Going low carb and mostly brought my own. What do you think? ,535,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds great! I don't think my chances for catching any fish are pretty slim!,535,4

mturk_agent_2,"Ok, great - I can give you all of my waters in exchange for a majority of the food and half of firewood",536,2
mturk_agent_1,Half of firewood? There are 3 so one of us has to get more. I would need more of that. ,536,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yep, I know there's three and no way to split evenly lol - can you give me a justifiable reason as to why you deserve more over me? Please convince me.",536,3

mturk_agent_2,What are your thoughts on the amount of water you need?,536,4
mturk_agent_1,I would need 2 out of 3 as well.,536,4
mturk_agent_2,Interesting - you're essentially saying that you need the majority of two of the three items. Hmm...,536,5
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, thats all. I need 1/3 food, 2/3 water, and 2/3 firewood.",536,5
mturk_agent_2,Still not convinced in any way that you need more items in total over me. Please clarify!,536,6
mturk_agent_1,"Food is what I prioritize much more than the others. If you want the majority of the others, I will need all the food.",536,6

mturk_agent_2,Since you are getting two firewoods I need two foods Let's deal on this.,538,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok. Then how about I get two waters. I need the food, too. I got four mouths to feed. ",538,3
mturk_agent_2,You can have 1 water.,538,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok. So then let's see. 2 firewood for me, 1 food for me, 1 water for me. 1 firewood for you. 2 food for you. 2 water for you. Does that sound good?",538,4
mturk_agent_2,That's a deal.,538,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,538,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,538,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi there! How are you?,539,0
mturk_agent_1,"Great! I'm very excited to go camping, how about you?",539,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am! Now, I need a lot of firewood because we were planning on burning some earlier (to start cooking meals and such). I also need some extra food in case bugs come and eat some (like last trip, ugh). How about I take 2 firewood, 2 food, and you take 3 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food?",539,1
mturk_agent_1,"Would you be open to taking 1 less firewood, I would give you 1 food for it. The weather is supposed to be extra chilly and we did not bring warm enough sleeping bags so we need the extra firewood to avoid freezing to death!",539,1
mturk_agent_2,"No, I would need more water if I were to take that deal.",539,2
mturk_agent_1,hmmm I am not willing to give that up. I think I would stick to your original proposal. ,539,2
mturk_agent_2,Okay cool. Let's go with my original deal.,539,3
mturk_agent_1,Yeah sounds good.,539,3
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,539,4

mturk_agent_2,Hi....Sooooo looking forward to a great realxing camping trip.🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂,54,0
mturk_agent_1,hi... yes i like camping trip,54,0
mturk_agent_2,I am hoping that I can get a little extra food though....I'm taking these new meds and they seem to make me hungry all the time. I was hoping to get another 2 pieces of food from the supplies.,54,1
mturk_agent_1,"okk i will give 2 pack firewood and 1 pack of food, 1 pack of water ",54,1
mturk_agent_2,"I wouldn't mind another firewood, if it isn't a bother...I tend to get really chilly when it's nightfall.",54,2
mturk_agent_1,ok what to you need explain,54,2
mturk_agent_2,I would love it if I could get 2 food...2 firewood and 1 water....🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂,54,3

mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,54,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,54,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I would like all of the water and 2 food packages. You can have all of the firewood and one food package. Does that sound good?",540,0
mturk_agent_1,"Nice to meet you! I definitely like the idea of having all of the firewood, but water is very important to me. Let's see if we can come to and agreement on how to split up the water.",540,0
mturk_agent_2,I typically drink a lot of water every day. So I can't agree with much less on that!,540,1
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, I'm sure we can something that works for both of us. The location I'm camping in is only accessible by foot, so I anticipate that I'll need a little more water than normal to feel completely safe. Is there any water source nearby your campsite?",540,1
mturk_agent_2,"Nothing that I would trust. Additionally, I have a dog that will need water as well.",540,2
mturk_agent_1,"Oh well that is something to consider. I love dogs. 🙂. I'd be willing to take less in that case, and let you have 2 of the waters. Would you be OK with leaving me with 1? I'd be willing to split the food up the same way (you get 2, I get 1).",540,2
mturk_agent_2,That works. I know water is important. I promise I won't be using it to water plants or wash clothes!,540,3
mturk_agent_1,"🙂 haha of course! I think we've come to a good agreement then! You get the 2 Waters, and I get Water. You get 2 Foods, and I get 1 Food. And I get the 3 Firewoods. Correct?",540,3
mturk_agent_2,That is perfect for me and my dog!  Yes!,540,4
mturk_agent_1,Perfect! I'll submit the deal shortly. What type of dog do you have?,540,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,540,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,540,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello How is preparing for your trip going?,541,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi! I've made some mistakes so I need some extra supplies. ☹️ Which item do you need the most?,541,0
mturk_agent_1,I need water the most we are campin  in arizona how about you,541,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh no. I need water the most too!,541,1
mturk_agent_1,well this should be intersting what do you need second most?,541,2
mturk_agent_2,I need food the second most.,541,2
mturk_agent_1,i need firewood the second most hoping to cook some yummy food!,541,3
mturk_agent_2,How about I get 2 water and all 3 food? You can have all 3 firewood and 1 water.,541,3
mturk_agent_1,sounds good to me,541,4
mturk_agent_2,Are you sure?,541,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,541,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,541,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi! Which items are important to you?,542,0
mturk_agent_1,Food is the most important to me because I need to eat more often so that I can take my medications.  ,542,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, that is important. I do not have a problem letting you have more food than me.",542,1
mturk_agent_1,Would it be possible to get an extra water also?  How do you feel about the firewood?  I wish we could split everything evenly.🙂,542,1
mturk_agent_2,Me too. Firewood is the most important thing to me. We will be somewhere cold and we could use the extra warmth.,542,2
mturk_agent_1,"True.  How about I get 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood. And that will leave you with 2 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food? ",542,2
mturk_agent_2,What do you need the extra water for?,542,3
mturk_agent_1,With the extra food I need I will need extra water also.  How about I only take 1 extra water?  ,542,3
mturk_agent_2,"So are you okay with you getting 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood and me getting 1 food, 2 water and 2 firewood? I'll do that deal.",542,4
mturk_agent_1,That should work.  I will conserve with my water and I should be fine.  So we have a deal?  ,542,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,542,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,542,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I'd like to get all of the water, an extra firewood and 2 of the food",543,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there.  That hardly leaves me with anything and doesn't really work for me.  I was hoping to make a campsite feast and get the extra food.  If we can do that, I'd be happy to give you all the water and that extra firewood.",543,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am a big guy, so I will need some more food, how about you give me an extra food while you hold on to two",543,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can't give you all the water if you take one of the food, I'm very sorry.  I could take 2 of the food and 2 of the water if we do it that way.  I really need cooking supplies if I want this trip to be productive for me - it's why I was coming.",543,1
mturk_agent_2,"That wouldn't work for me, I will be going hiking during camping, so I need all of the water I can get",543,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well then maybe we can just do a trade, the water to you and the food to me.  And if I got two of the firewood, I'd have plenty of time to just boil and purify some riverwater instead",543,2
mturk_agent_2,That does not seem entirely fare but I need more water so I will take this deal,543,3
mturk_agent_1,"It's honestly not that fair to me either, but sometimes we just end up with slightly conflicting priorities in life.  🙂  I think making the best of the situation is the way forward.",543,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, That's true,🙂, so do we have a deal?",543,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yup, the food to me, the water to you, and 2 of the firewood to me, 1 to you is as I understand it!",543,4
mturk_agent_2,"That's correct, a deal it is then",543,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,543,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,543,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi how are you hope all is well and are you getting ready for your trip?,544,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes same to you. I am very excited to be going on this trip cannot wait to start hiking. Do you have any plans for yours?,544,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes we (my boyfriend daughter and I) want to go to the mountain top its not going to be easy with this weather but we will make it how about YOu?,544,1
mturk_agent_2,We want to hike along the trails near the river! We will need lots of food to keep us going ,544,1
mturk_agent_1,"I understand that atleast you are going to be close to water, that will be our most important thing since we will be thirsty and you know kids and trying to tell them to ration the water...LOL",544,2
mturk_agent_2,for sure thats not going to work to well ,544,2
mturk_agent_1,are you hiking alone?,544,3
mturk_agent_2,no i will have my husband and my dog with me,544,3
mturk_agent_1,oh nice well how about you give me 3 water and I give you 3 food and we figure out the wood make a suggestion,544,4
mturk_agent_2,ill take one you get twoa/,544,4
mturk_agent_1,that sounds perfect to me.,544,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,544,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,544,6
mturk_agent_1,hy thats my offer,545,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there.. I'm sorry, I didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages, I believe.  So, here's the situation.. I think I can get by with less firewood as I'm a Floridian and prefer it cooler anyway.. also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but I'm definitely interested in as much water as possible.. both for cooking and cleaning purposes, as well as drinking, of course.  🙂",545,0
mturk_agent_1,okay so what do you suggest,545,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I recognize you're gonna need water too.. so I'd love to take 2 of them, giving you one and I'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food.. that way we all ensure we have enough.. you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but I think its best for both of us 🙂",545,1
mturk_agent_1,i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods,545,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, sorry, that's not going to work out for me.  I'm going to need at least 2 bottles of water, 1 food packet, and one firewood.. again, this does leave you with two each on the food and the firewood, which are both very important things for this camping trip!",545,2
mturk_agent_1,but thats the only offer im willing to give,545,3
mturk_agent_2,Well then unfortunately I think we're gonna have to walk away from this and neither of us gets anything we could both use.. that's unfortunate and I'm sorry to see it end in such a less than magnanimous fashion ☹️,545,3
mturk_agent_1,you need water and i need food so unless we do 1 food  to 1water is tht okay,545,4
mturk_agent_2,"I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.. I can't really budge on the water.. BUT.. I could do something where I take 2 water, and only one firewood, but two food.. does that work for you?",545,4
mturk_agent_1,so if i were to  give you water what would i get ?,545,5
mturk_agent_2,"You'd be getting 1 water, 2 firewood, and 1 food",545,5
mturk_agent_1,how much food are you willing to offer for water,545,6
mturk_agent_2,"We can go back to my original offer which was honestly more generous.. I get 2 Water, 1 Firewood, 1 food.. you get 1 water, 2 firewood, 2 food.. its honestly a better deal for you 🙂",545,6
mturk_agent_1,no its not i give you i water i get 1 food and 1 firewood,545,7
mturk_agent_2,"We only have 3 of each to divide up.. so yes, you're going to have to give me one more on an item.. but in exchange I'm giving you 1 more on two different items.  I'm getting 4 items in total, you're getting 5.. - You're essentially netting 11% more 'items' than I am in this deal. ",545,7
mturk_agent_1,thats the point as you need water so badly,545,8
mturk_agent_2,Correct.. I do.. but if you're not willing to budge on this where you're still netting more overall value I understand - I'm bummed but I understand.,545,8
mturk_agent_1,im contented with  what i have but im willing to trade as yu need more water so i need t make a profit,545,9
mturk_agent_2,"That's unfortunate then as instead of making a tiny bit less of a profit now you're not going to make any because you would rather give up the deal.  Also, if you do the math, you'll see that I'm actually benefiting you here - I understand, though.  I can put through the offer and hope you change your mind so we both benefit.",545,9
mturk_agent_1,im fine with that,545,10
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,545,10

mturk_agent_1,"Hey, how are you?",547,0
mturk_agent_2,I am doing good. Thanks. Which item do you need the most?,547,1
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking firewood, because the most fun I have camping is roasting marshmellows and hanging out around there. How about you?",547,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh hmm. I really need extra firewood because I forgot to bring a sleeping bag. I will be freezing to death at night. ☹️,547,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, well tell me what you need the least of, if you don't mind.",547,2
mturk_agent_2,You can have all of the water if you let me have all of the firewood.,547,3
mturk_agent_1,"hmm, here's what I'm willing to do. I will take all the water, one firewood and one food.",547,3
mturk_agent_2,That doesn't sound fair to me.,547,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, what would you counter offer with?",547,4
mturk_agent_2,I would like all 3 packages of firewood and 1 package of food. You can have the rest.,547,5
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I would like at least one firewood, it is the thing I most need.",547,5
mturk_agent_2,"But you need firewood for leisure, whereas I need firewood for survival.",547,6
mturk_agent_1,"Well it will keep us warm at night, too. I am very keen on at least one firewood for myself. ",547,6
mturk_agent_2,Ok. How about I take 2 firewood and all 3 food? You can have the rest.,547,7
mturk_agent_1,Can I get at least one food?,547,7
mturk_agent_2,"Would you be willing to trade that for one water? So I take 2 firewood, 2 food, and 1 water?",547,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,547,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,547,9
mturk_agent_2,Hi we would like you to consider giving us all of the rations for the trip.,548,0
mturk_agent_1,"hello, that could be a good idea, but I think I need more rations",548,0
mturk_agent_2,"How important are they to you? We would like to get a good mix, preferably more food.",548,1
mturk_agent_1,"I need more food and water, you see I am diabetic, I need to eat many small meals",548,1
mturk_agent_2,😡 I can let the firewood and water lax if you provide us food.,548,2
mturk_agent_1,"let me have two food and three parts of water, I can let you have all the firewood and one fpart food",548,2
mturk_agent_2,"We do have a fire to start, but we are very hungry. Diabetics can eat less food because of the small meals. Don't lie to me.",548,3
mturk_agent_1,😡my type of diabetes needs many meals otherwise my insulin levels will be low,548,3
mturk_agent_2,I am diabetic also.,548,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello hope you are excited for the trip Im hoping we can discuss the supplies. I would like to get 2 water 1 food and 2 of the firewood ,549,0
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you 2 waters and 1 food, but I really need more firewood. I ran out last time and I don't want to go through that again! How about you take 2 waters, 1 food, and 1 firewood? ",549,0
mturk_agent_2,I feel like we are almost there I hunt so im ok with the one food; why would  I only get one firewood?,549,1
mturk_agent_1,I just want to make sure that I don't run out. I will have my kids with me and need to make sure they don't get too cold 🙂,549,1
mturk_agent_2,Understandable I am an avid outdoorsmen; Starting firewood is hard and can also be dangerous; how about you give me the two I will only use one you get one and I will be able to secure more within a few hours. ,549,2
mturk_agent_1,Are you sure that you would be able to get more firewood on your own?,549,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes and as a return ill give you 70 percent of what I get-- So with me managing the firewood for you, you will get more time with the kids.",549,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's so nice of you! I would just feel more secure if I kept 2 of the firewood with me while you are out though, just in case of emergency. You wouldn't need it just for the few hours you would be gone. ",549,3
mturk_agent_2,If that were the case I would need extra food since I would be behind trying to get more firewood..  ,549,4
mturk_agent_1,That makes sense. I would be willing to split the extra food package with you when you get back to camp. Then we would be even all the way around.  ,549,4

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,549,5
mturk_agent_1,Hey there how are you?,55,0
mturk_agent_2,I am fine friend. I need a lot of firewood though. It is freezing,55,0
mturk_agent_1,"I definitely need firewood as well. We didn't anticipate it being as freezing cold as it is at night. There isn't much around us. We've also been using a lot of water, which we could use more of since we've been looking for firewood.",55,1
mturk_agent_2,Your needs are like mine. I have a condition that require  me to shower quite often. It is a shame but if I do not shower for 3 hours I will stink.  ,55,1
mturk_agent_1,Well fortunately if you are camping that won't be too bad. You'll blend in with the wilderness.,55,2
mturk_agent_2,My friends will run away. I will not be comfortable either. So how do we split what we have?,55,2
mturk_agent_1,"If they're true friends, they won't. I'll take 2 firewood, 2 water, 3 food.",55,3
mturk_agent_2,That is very unfair ☹️,55,3
mturk_agent_1,"2 firewood, 1 water, 3 food?",55,4
mturk_agent_2,"I am willing to give you 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food.",55,4
mturk_agent_1,"I'll do 3 firewood, 1 water, 1 food.",55,5
mturk_agent_2,I am not giving up on firewood at all. That is the most I can offer. otherwise I will see myself out,55,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,55,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,55,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I'm in need of some extra food for my trip.  I just checked and some of my food is past the expiration date.",550,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi friend! How are you. Food is a non negotiable for me. We currently don't have enough for our trip.,550,0
mturk_agent_2,Everything is negotiable 🙂 but if you absolutely can't budge on the food then I will need some extra firewood and water to make up for it.,550,1
mturk_agent_1,We cannot budge at all on food. But are more then happy to give up all the extra fire wood for all the food. ,550,1
mturk_agent_2,Could you trade one food item for either one firewood or water?,550,2
mturk_agent_1,"How about this- You will get 1 food, 1 water and 3 Firewood. I will get 2 Food and 2 Water with 0 Firewood. ",550,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, I think I would prefer your original offer instead.  You can have all the food if I can have all the rest.",550,3
mturk_agent_1,Hmmm i don't beleive i ever offered you everything for all the food. I will need at least one water. lets not be selfish.,550,3
mturk_agent_2,"Oh you are right sorry, I was mistaken.  Okay then, how about I get 1 food, 2 waters, and 3 firewood.  You can have 2 food and 1 water?",550,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well that would give you 6 rations and me 3. Again that is not very fair. If you want 1 food and all the fire wood that i need at least 2 waters. so again, 1 food, 1 water 3 wood for you",550,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, you have a deal. 🙂",550,5

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,550,6
mturk_agent_2,Hi:  I  have invited friends from a nearby campsite for dinner and i heard it is going to be really cold tonight. I would prefer to have some extra fire wood for sure. lly cold tonight.,551,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi I am also going camping. Unfortunately I need as much firewood and water as possible too. I need to be able to cook our food and stay warm all night ,551,0
mturk_agent_2,Can I ask how many people are camping with you? Are you planning on hiking the mountain?,551,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh yes, I have my whole family coming. I'm really excited because we don't see each other often. My aunts, uncles, cousins. Some of us will hike while others stay back. Maybe we can come to an agreement? Will you also be hiking?",551,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes hiking for sure.  If I take 2 firewoods and give you 2 waters and 1 food, would that be acceptable?",551,2
mturk_agent_1,I think that could work ,551,2
mturk_agent_2,Thank you.  Have a great time and stay safe. It's going to be a blast for sure. ,551,3
mturk_agent_1,Camping is always such a fun time. Maybe we will run into each other ,551,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that would be fun.  I heard it is going to be unseasonably cold at night, so stay warm.  You'll have lots of family member to huddle together in a tent ",551,4

mturk_agent_1,You said you would give me 2 waters and 1 food for your 2 firewoods ,551,7
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, does that work for you.  I could give you 1 water and 2 foods as I really need the water for my hike.  I tend to overheat easily. ",551,8
mturk_agent_1,You are flipping it around. I can't give you 2 water and 2 firewood as that wouldn't really be fair ,551,8
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, how about if I give you 3 foods and you give me the 2 firewoods and 2 waters?",551,9
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,551,9
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,551,10
mturk_agent_2,"THanks, but I really need the water. I thought you would enjoy the food with so  many guests in your campsite. Is that a possibility?",551,10
mturk_agent_1,"I don't need 3 foods and we already agreed on 2 firewood, 1 water and 2 food. If that is not possible, I wonder if we can not make a deal ",551,11
mturk_agent_2,Okay.  I will agree as the firewood is very important to me. The food will also come in handy on my long hike up the mountain.  Stay safe and have fun. ,551,11
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,551,12
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,551,12
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I would like to take all of the firewood and two of the water packages. You can take all of the food and the other water package. ",552,0
mturk_agent_2,I am not a fan of that deal,552,0
mturk_agent_1,That's alright. Do you have anything you need in particular? ,552,1
mturk_agent_2,I need food and water,552,1
mturk_agent_1,I need water too. One of mine has a leak.☹️,552,2
mturk_agent_2,"the temperature is 115 degrees F where I go,  If I don't have extra water I will not make it",552,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds awful 😮. Would you settle for you taking two of the water packages and leaving me one?,552,3
mturk_agent_2,I guess if I can have 2 food and you can have 2 firewood,552,3
mturk_agent_1,Some of my firewood is wet (and basically useless unless it dries in time). So how about 3 firewood and 1 water for me and you can have the rest. ,552,4
mturk_agent_2,Ok that sounds good,552,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,552,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,552,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I'm super excited to camping with my family! We have had to cancel all our original travel plans due to Covid and we're really looking forward to this trip. Especially my son! He's been so restless at home. Are you going camping too?,553,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I am! I can't wait. I'm going on a 3 week trip to this gorgeous lake.",553,0
mturk_agent_1,"Wow, 3 weeks is a long camping trip! I don't know if I have enough supplies to go for a trip that long. Are you doing a cabin-style or really roughing it? My husband and son want to do a lot of hiking so we're thinking of moving camp daily.",553,1
mturk_agent_2,"that's awesome! I know, I'm a little worried about my food supplies but I think I can figure everything else out. No, we're roughing it, my boyfriend's huge on camping.",553,1
mturk_agent_1,"Lol, at least it sounds like you've got an expert with you. My husband is really gung-ho but he tends to fly by the edge of his seat when it comes to stuff like planning. He's says he wants to travel light and that he got these water filter straws so that we could drink lake water but I'm super sketched out... I don't want us getting something like schistosomiasis. And I want to make sure everyone stays hydrated with all of the hiking they want to do",553,2
mturk_agent_2,"I get that. I'm going to risk it with the lake water because I'd personally love to have enough food to last 3 weeks (which I'm a little worried about as it is), so I can definitely help you out with the water.",553,2
mturk_agent_1,thanks! where do you plan on camping? I know popular places are worried about spreading Covid and a lot of offices that give out camping permits are closed.,553,3
mturk_agent_2,"We're going to check out Acadia National Park. I'm not totally sure on the details, I'm letting my boyfriend plan and I'm just handling the packing haha",553,3
mturk_agent_1,"Lol, that's totally understandable. Are you planning to make any campfires?",553,4
mturk_agent_2,"Some, but I'm not too worried about my firewood stock. I'm pretty sure there's a decent amount of wood out there in the park.",553,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,553,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,553,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello.  I hope you are well.  I would like to have all of the water, 2 of the firewood and 1 of the food.  ",554,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello.  I'm actually not doing too well.  There have been a few problems and I will need some of the extra packages.  I'll need two of the waters, 2 of the firewood and 2 of the food.",554,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm sorry to hear that you are not doing well.  I've also have some issues.  On the way up to the camp site, all of my clean water spilled in the car.  I was really hoping to be able to get all of the available water.  Why aren't you well?  I hope it's not serious.  ☹️",554,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, that's terrible.  I'm sorry that happened.  I need the water for my child.  They seem dehydrated and disoriented.  My husband has also caught a cold and has been having chills.  I thought the extra firewood would help him feel better.",554,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh my gosh.  You are not having an easy trip.  If your children are dehydrated and disoriented, perhaps you should get them to emergency care immediately.  I would like to provide you will all of the water in the meantime, but that would leave me with none at all.  I wouldn't have your husband out of the tent with chills.  Perhaps you should keep him bundled in your cabin.  I forgot my portable propane grill - so I would need some firewood.  How about I take 2 waters, 1 firewood and all of the food?",554,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh dear, you spilled your water and forgot your grill?  You mentioned that you had a car.  Perhaps you could take a quick drive to grab some extra water.  For now, I definitely agree that you need 1 extra water and 1 firewood.  I will need 2 of the extra food portions though.  How does that sound? ",554,2
mturk_agent_1,"Wish it was an easy car ride.  We're miles and miles from a store and it's getting dark.  I don't do well driving in the dark.  I think we might be getting close to agreement.  As I understand it:  you would get 1 water, 2 firewood and 2 food portions?  Is that correct?",554,3
mturk_agent_2,"Actually, I suggested that you would get 1 water, 1 firewood and 1 food portion.  I can compromise with you though.  I would like 2 water portions, 1 firewood and 1 food.",554,3
mturk_agent_1,"Since I arrived with no water at all, I would definitely need at least 2 waters.  I'm afraid I don't have a lot of ""wiggle room"" with that.  I'm open for the other supplies.  Ideally, I would like to have 2 waters, 1 firewood and 1 food portion.",554,4
mturk_agent_2,"If that's the case, I would like 1 water, 3 firewood and 3 food portions.",554,4
mturk_agent_1,"Would you be open to me having 2 waters, and 1 food portion?  While trying to get together some wood to start a fire, I came across a stray pup.  He seems very friendly - so I'm thinking he must have gotten separated from his family.  He's very hungry though - an extra food portion would be a great help.",554,5
mturk_agent_2,Deal,554,5
mturk_agent_1,Wonderful!  I'll submit our deal now.  It was nice working with you.  All the best to you and your family - take care of them!  😮,554,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,554,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,554,7
mturk_agent_2,I would like to take at least two of the food items because I get sick easily and faint if I do not have enough food. You can have two of the waters but I would like one. ,555,0
mturk_agent_1,yes i could take two of the foods because i i leave some of mine. thank you,555,0
mturk_agent_2,how much firewood do you need and why?,555,1

mturk_agent_2,"Okay, repeat the full deal to me so I can make sure we are on the same page.",555,4

mturk_agent_2,"Sure, I want to make sure I have one firewood at a minimum. ",556,1
mturk_agent_1,What would you want in return?,556,2
mturk_agent_2,I like to eat.  I think extra food is good.  Are you willing to let me have all three food packs? 🙂,556,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would want to keep at least one packet of food for myself, unless you want to just swap 3 firewoods for 3 packets of food, to keep it simple?",556,3
mturk_agent_2,I like your plan.  It is simple. I will agree to that.,556,3
mturk_agent_1,"So all that is left is water, i guess i should atleast drink alot of it if i wont eat much haha 🙂",556,4
mturk_agent_2,"For sure, and you will need some way to put out the fire. 😮",556,4
mturk_agent_1,"Haha good point, you worked with me on the firewood so i am ok with you getting two waters and i will get one, deal?",556,5

mturk_agent_1,Is firewood something you want the most? 🙂,558,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes friend.Because we are going to a snow fall place so we need firewood the most.,558,3
mturk_agent_1,"I don't need firewood that much, you can have all of that",558,4

mturk_agent_1,Hi 🙂 I'd like to have more water because the location that I'm going to is really dry. I'll need water to stay hydrated.,559,0
mturk_agent_2,Sure you can give me firewood in place of water,559,0
mturk_agent_1,Thank you 🙂 That works for me. I'm also in my first trimester so I'll need a bit of extra food since I'm feeding my little one. Is that alright with you?,559,1
mturk_agent_2,Woah... You can take more food as well,559,1
mturk_agent_1,Thank you dear! :D I really appreciate that. Are you okay with how everything is divided up then?,559,2
mturk_agent_2,Sure,559,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds great. So I have 1 firewood, 2 waters, 2 foods. And you have 2 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food. Let me know if that's alright",559,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sure... I will be going with friends, I can manage with that.",559,3

mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,559,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,559,5
mturk_agent_1,i suggest we put excess in charge of working on proposition because prevention of excess is not a good first step.,56,0
mturk_agent_2,"I don't know what you mean by ""prevention of excess."" Can you clarify?",56,0
mturk_agent_1,what i mean by prevention of excess is that we should focus on getting excess and not to limit it regardless of what we already have because if we should offer some creative approaches by excess. we can both come to an agreement if you are interested.,56,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay. Lets just try to do some negotiation. I am the most interested in getting more WATER. The water I already have at the campsite looks dirty so, if it is okay with you, I would like all THREE of them. My food has also been stolen by bears and I don't make much left, so I would like TWO of the food items. You can have all the firewood and the other food item. How does that sound? 🙂",56,1
mturk_agent_1,"😮Sound good enough but since you know i can not do without having anything to sustain me whenever i am thirsty then i suggest you are free to take TWO of the water and since your food has also been stolen by bears and you don't make much left, then you can have the TWO of the food items too and leave the THREE firewood for me with ONE food. How does that sound? 🙂",56,2
mturk_agent_2,I think we are getting very close to a good deal. Would you be willing to give me ONE firewood in case the stuff I have gets wet?,56,2
mturk_agent_1,I strongly agree and shall we call it a deal now? 🙂,56,3
mturk_agent_2,"Like I said, we are close but I really would feel better with just one of the firewood. I'm afraid of not being able to build a fire. If you really need the firewood, however, then I would take one additional item of EITHER the water or food instead.",56,3
mturk_agent_1,"And like I said, I strongly agree and you can have ONE firewood now. Deal close ?",56,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes. I think this is a fair deal.,56,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,56,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,56,5
mturk_agent_1,I am running low on firewood. I need more to keep the fire going and cook food. ,560,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah I need firewood too. It's only 50 degrees at night on the mountain, even in the summer.",560,0
mturk_agent_1,How would you feel about giving me some firewood for food?,560,1
mturk_agent_2,"Maybe, I need food too but I want firewood the most.",560,1
mturk_agent_1,Do you have a deal to offer?,560,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would like 2 firewood, and I don't care about anything else. I would give you 2 water and 3 food",560,2
mturk_agent_1,I will give you 1 firewood for 3 waters and 3 foods. ,560,3
mturk_agent_2,Nah I'll pass,560,3
mturk_agent_1,Do you have another deal to offer? ☹️,560,4
mturk_agent_2,I'll give you 3 food and 3 water and 1 firewood,560,4

mturk_agent_1,"hello, lets share these items. I really need the firewood. I have asthma and I have to stay warm",561,0
mturk_agent_2,How much firewood do you need?,561,0
mturk_agent_1,i need two food items and one water,561,1
mturk_agent_2,"I will take 2 waters, however I would like 2 food and you can have 1 food and 3 firewoods",561,1
mturk_agent_1,one food is not enough i am pregnant and i need to eat many meals,561,2
mturk_agent_2,My friend is ill and needs to eat to survive. How about I take 3 water then and you can have 2 food and all of the wood?,561,2
mturk_agent_1,sounds reasonable,561,3
mturk_agent_2,Great! glad we could come to an agreement. May I ask why you are camping while pregnant?,561,3
mturk_agent_1,"its fun, pregnancy cravings🙂",561,4

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,561,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I really need more firewood, in exchange for me taking more of that you can have more food and we can split the water evenly 🙂",562,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, nice interacting with you. I'll need additional package of water as I need to cook as well.",562,0
mturk_agent_2,"ok, if i get all 3 extra firewood, I'd be fine with getting 1 extra water while you get 2? food is a really low priority for me",562,1
mturk_agent_1,"Same here as well as I have carried enough but yes, I need firewood as most of y food requires cooking and specially my kids prefer having food hot.",562,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ok thats fair, I would prefer to have more firewood since I'm awful at collecting firewood while out. But we could be a more even split of it all. 2/1 for both. Do you need more water or more firewood?",562,2
mturk_agent_1,"I need more firewood, I can maage with 1 additional package of water.",562,2
mturk_agent_2,"ok, so I'd get 1 firewood, 2 water. Now for food, If we continue with an even split I'd much prefer getting 2 extra food. that would bring us up to a near even split overall ",562,3
mturk_agent_1,Ok. I get it and that would be fair as I already have enough food.,562,3
mturk_agent_2,"ok thank you. I should be able to get by pretty well with this deal, extra food means I can bring more friends 🙂",562,4
mturk_agent_1,I'm glad that you are happy with the deal as well.,562,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,562,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,562,5
mturk_agent_2,What are your preferences for water?,563,0
mturk_agent_1,Water is not something I want to haul on my camping trip.  I would like to haul extra wood though.  ,563,0
mturk_agent_2,I would actually prefer more water,563,1
mturk_agent_1,That is great.  Looks like we are on our way to making a deal.  How do you feel about wood?  ,563,1
mturk_agent_2,I would prefer less wood so that's great,563,2
mturk_agent_1,"I do not like camping and find comfort in food, so I would like to take all the extra food that I can.  ",563,2
mturk_agent_2,I think that can be negoiated then i tend to eat less on camping trips,563,3
mturk_agent_1,Great!  So looks like all the water goes to you.  I will take all the food if that is ok and we can split the wood.  ,563,3
mturk_agent_2,Well i would need one food and one wood,563,4
mturk_agent_1,"OK.  I think that will work out for me.  You get 3 water, 1 wood and 1 food.  I will take the rest.",563,4
mturk_agent_2,Great that's an agreement for me,563,5

mturk_agent_2,"I don't care about the firewood, but I would like food and water the most.",564,1
mturk_agent_1,you can take water if i get all the firewood and some food,564,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'll take all the water, you can take all the firewood. What would be fair for the food?",564,2
mturk_agent_1,we have to split it somehow,564,3
mturk_agent_2,"Food is my highest priority, but i am willing to take 1 for all the water.",564,3
mturk_agent_1,"that would be perfect for us, thank you, we have enough water",564,4

mturk_agent_2,"I'm going camping too and also need food and wood, mostly food though",565,1
mturk_agent_1,Okay I understand that! Is there a particular reason that you do not need much water?,565,2
mturk_agent_2,I figure I could always get some at the stream 🙂,565,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I agree, but are you aware of the water quality at your campsite? ",565,3
mturk_agent_2,Not completely aware but I do have a filter that I brought from home. What are your needs?,565,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok me too! I am concerned the most with firewood as it is the basis for my camping activities: campfire, story telling, and producing heat. ",565,4
mturk_agent_2,OK so how about you take 2 firewoods and 1 food,565,4
mturk_agent_1,That works for me. May I have two waters since I have more of a need of water,565,5
mturk_agent_2,That works for me since I have the filter!,565,5

mturk_agent_1,Me too! Camping is so much fun,566,0
mturk_agent_2,I will want to get some extra supplies before I go. ,566,1
mturk_agent_1,Same. My family is coming with me so I want to make sure we are extra prepared,566,1
mturk_agent_2,Me too. We invited a lot of extra friends,566,2
mturk_agent_1,I am hoping we have enough food. I'm worried we might run out so I'd like to get some more ,566,2
mturk_agent_2,I know we need extra food too and some firewood. Maybe a little water but we shouldn't need too much,566,3
mturk_agent_1,It sounds like we are looking for the same things. I think there are some extra we can share. Do you have an idea about how it can be the most fair? ,566,3
mturk_agent_2,how about I'll give you 2 food if you give me 2 firewood and 2 of the water?,566,4
mturk_agent_1,I think that is a fair deal! ,566,4
mturk_agent_2,"great, let's do it",566,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,566,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,566,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, lets get things started. How would you like to split items?",567,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! Hope your after noon is going well! I have 2 kids so I feel like the water is the most important for them. Need to keep they hydrated, ya know? 🙂",567,0
mturk_agent_2,I also need water with my medical condition I have to take lots of meds. I can give you extra firewood so you can boil more water easily.,567,1
mturk_agent_1,Dang. I'm sorry for your condition. I really don't need the firewood though as I cut so much this year.. How can we negotiate? I'd hate for something to happen to you.,567,1
mturk_agent_2,We can try to figure out a way to split the water and food in the fairest way 🙂. Firewood isn't an issue so it doesn't matter as much. I think to start something like splitting the food 2/1 and the water 1/2?,567,2
mturk_agent_1,That might work. I can always boil it and I could use the extra food for the kids.,567,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok so I propose 2 water for me, 1 for you. 2 food for you, 1 for me. Firewood would be, 2 for you, 1 for me? Please give me your opinion if you want to reverse any of that.",567,3
mturk_agent_1,"That would work, the extra firewood would offset the need to have water on hand when I can boil it.",567,3
mturk_agent_2,"Just take one more minute to make sure you are good with that and let me know. As soon as you are absolutely sure, I will send the proposal.",567,4
mturk_agent_1,You need the water more I feel. I don't want to slight you for having a medical condition and I know how the heat can take a toll on people. I think that proposal works well enough as I'm getting extra firewood and food. ,567,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,567,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,567,5
mturk_agent_2,I am going to submit my initial offer now.,568,0
mturk_agent_1,ok,568,0
mturk_agent_2,So I really don't need that much firewood. I am willing to give you all 3. What is your situation?,568,1
mturk_agent_1,I have a lot of people here.I need food.,568,1
mturk_agent_2,"I also need food, but am willing to share and give you extra firewood so you can cook more food. I am not able to hunt or fish and the extra food will help if I am not able to get around. ",568,2
mturk_agent_1,I can share water for firewood.,568,2
mturk_agent_2,"Optimally, I would like 3 food and 2 water which would leave you with 0 food, 1 water and 3 firewood. I think it will be easier if you also tell me your optimal wants then we can go from there.",568,3
mturk_agent_1,We could each keep 3 food.,568,3
mturk_agent_2,"No, that won't work. There is only 3 total of food, water and firewood each.",568,4
mturk_agent_1,oops I forgot-2 food for you 1 for me,568,4

mturk_agent_1,"Yes, camping trips can be quite fun. I am sure it will be a plesant experience for them.",569,1
mturk_agent_2,Yah we have a few things planned. One of the things they are looking forward to is reading scary stories by the campfire and making s'mores,569,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds like a lot of fun. What do you think you will need for that experience?,569,2
mturk_agent_2,We likely need a lot of firewood and some water to put out the fire when we are done lol. What are you thinking?,569,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yea, I'm not too into firewood because it will be quite hot when I make my camping trip. I could definitely use some more food just in case of an emergency out there.",569,3
mturk_agent_2,"Then how about I give you all my food in exchange for all the firewood and since I have to put out the fire, maybe 2 water for me and 1 for you?",569,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds like a fair deal. I have no problem with that one.,569,4

mturk_agent_1,"I don't think you that fat, your lipids will help you stay warm and full out there, haha",57,2
mturk_agent_2,Im not as good at you at foraginf for food and water i probably dont have the experience as you do being in the outdoors and living off the land.🙂,57,3
mturk_agent_1,"With the extra firewood, you can hunt for fish and other animals outside to thrive",57,3
mturk_agent_2,i cant hunt if i dont have the proper nutritional value to make sure i can make it that long.  how about i get 2 firewood 2 water and 1 food you get the rest,57,4
mturk_agent_1,"Hmmm, how about this, you will get 2 firewood, 1 food and 1 water to start with?",57,4
mturk_agent_2,ill do 1 firewood and one water if i get all the firewood ,57,5

mturk_agent_1,"I actually got really dehydrated on my last camping trip, so don't want to be completely without water. How about 2 for you, 1 for me?",570,1
mturk_agent_2,"That is good, is it possible that I could get some firewood as well? I may be suffering from hypothermia.",570,2
mturk_agent_1,"Oh wow! I don't want you to be that cold! :o  If I can have 3 food, I'd be happy for you to have 2 firewood.",570,2
mturk_agent_2,"That would be great, I'm not real hungry, so I can spare some food.",570,3
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds fair to me! So we've got 2 water and 2 firewood for you, 3 food and 1 each water and firewood for me.",570,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, you're very kind. I desperately need some more water and firewood.",570,4

mturk_agent_1,"no i need 2 pack of firewood, and 1 pack of food and 1 pack of water ",571,2
mturk_agent_2,That is quite unfair. You will have 0 water,571,3
mturk_agent_1,please at least give one pack of water?,571,3
mturk_agent_2,"Alright, 0 food then? This is because only the firewood is significant for outside weather.",571,4
mturk_agent_1,ok what you want now explain,571,4
mturk_agent_2,You can take 2 firewood and 1 water.,571,5

mturk_agent_1,I need a lot of food and I get cold easily. What is your top priority?,572,1
mturk_agent_2,"Food is comforting to me so I would like to have plenty of food on hand to eat during this dreadful trip.  I will need plenty of fire wood to cook it, but am not as worried about the water.  ",572,2
mturk_agent_1,I need a lot of food as well but I'm willing to sacrifice it if I get all the firewood and water.,572,2
mturk_agent_2,Thank you.  WOuld you be willing to give me all the food?  I would give you all the water and 2 firewood.,572,3
mturk_agent_1,I can give you all the food and 1 water. I get all firewood and 2 water.,572,3
mturk_agent_2,I need at least one firewood to cook my food.  Can you give me one firewood for all the water?,572,4
mturk_agent_1,I'm sorry. I won't be able to do that.,572,4
mturk_agent_2,"SO you will give me 3 food, no firewood and 2 water?",572,5
mturk_agent_1,"Because I get cold easily and need water for cleaning, my final offer is 3 food/1 water for you and 3 firewood/2 water for me. Because I'm not getting any food, anything less, I cannot do.",572,5

mturk_agent_2,"Okay, that makes sense. But I also need to keep warm.",573,1
mturk_agent_1,"I think I can get by with 2 firewood, and give you 1.",573,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, I think I need firewood more than anything else. Would you take 1 firewood and 2 food?",573,2
mturk_agent_1,"If I do that, I will need all the food, since I won't be able to cook much fish.",573,3
mturk_agent_2,I see. I do need at least 1 food package because I will be spending lots of calories working. But I can give you all the water.,573,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about this, you get one firewood and one food, and I get all the water?",573,4
mturk_agent_2,"No, sorry. How about you get one firewood, two food and all the water?",573,4

mturk_agent_2,Pretty good. I'm really excited about going camping though!,574,1
mturk_agent_1,Me too. I haven't been camping for several years. ,574,2
mturk_agent_2,"What type of place are you thinking of going camping to? Like what is the climate/area? More desert or forest, etc?",574,2
mturk_agent_1,"Forest, for sure. Deserts have scorpions and tarantulas and I'm scared of those.",574,3
mturk_agent_2,Amen! Me too! 🙂 I too was thinking of going to the forest. Is your forest going to be wet or pretty dry?,574,3
mturk_agent_1,It'll be pretty dry. I don't want to catch a cold. ,574,4
mturk_agent_2,I wanted to a rainforest near where I live. I love listening to the rain. Did you think that you were going to need all of the firewood since you can get dry wood from the trees?,574,4
mturk_agent_1,"So, lets negotiate for the supplies.  ",574,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,574,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,574,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello!  I've been super thirsty and as a result I was wondering if I could get all 3 packages of water?,575,0
mturk_agent_1,I like to hike and will need additional water. Can I take one package and you can have the other two? ,575,0
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good to me.  Do you have any kind of preference for firewood or food?,575,1
mturk_agent_1,I would need additional food to sustain my energy for my hikes. Do you mind if I take two packages of the food? What are your thoughts? ,575,1
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good to me.,575,2
mturk_agent_1,Do you want any of the firewood? Would you be okay if I got two packages of the firewood? ,575,2
mturk_agent_2,It's been pretty cold at night.  Do you think you would be able to carry the two packages of firewood?,575,3
mturk_agent_1,"I should be fine, thank you. 🙂 It will be a little bit of work hauling all of my gear and supplies but after I set up camp, it will be smooth sailing. ",575,3
mturk_agent_2,I'm thinking that we will be able to work out that deal.  I do have the water and that's my main thing I needed.,575,4
mturk_agent_1,"That's great, I'm glad we came to an agreement. ",575,4

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,575,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, I was thinking that I could take all of the food items, and 2 of the firewood items. My friend has low blood sugar and they need the food in case they crash, and the warmth of the fire to maintain at evening.",576,0
mturk_agent_1,"Water is my highest priority, what is yours? Is it food?",576,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, food is my highest. It's necessary for my friend to keep extra around just in case he crashes. Why is water your highest priority?",576,1
mturk_agent_1,I need the water to drink - I don't trust the water I might find at the campsite.,576,1
mturk_agent_2,Did you bring any water to start?,576,2
mturk_agent_1,Yes! Did you bring any food to start?,576,2
mturk_agent_2,"I did, but my friend only feels comfortable with extra around, God forbid, if something happens this could save his life. So I'm thinking, I take all three food packages, two firewood packages and leave all three water and one firewood for you. ",576,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think that it is fair that you get three food and I get three water, but why should you get two firewood to my one?",576,3
mturk_agent_2,"The food is not for me, I'm not allowed to touch it. t\The only real benefit I'm getting here is firewood. ☹️",576,4
mturk_agent_1,"OK,that sounds good. So you get three Food, I get three Water, and we split the Firewood, you get two and I get one.",576,4
mturk_agent_2,"That works, thank you for your understanding.",576,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,576,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,576,6

mturk_agent_2,Maybe I could take 2 firewood 2 food and 0 waters?,577,0
mturk_agent_1,I was planning on staying up all night and keeping my fire going all night.  Honestly I could give you all the extra food if that helps you if I could please have the 3 firewood?  We could split the waters,577,1
mturk_agent_2,I'll only give you all the firewood if you give me everything else. I know it's your top priority😮,577,1
mturk_agent_1,"How about I take all the wood, give you all the food, you can have 2 waters and I can have one.  Having a little extra water will help me with all the hiking we will be doing, plus since i wont be eating much I want to stay hydrated.  Will that work for you>>🙂",577,2
mturk_agent_2,cringe ☹️. Ill take one firewood and two of both water and food ,577,2
mturk_agent_1,Sorry - I just cant do that.  I want to come to an agreement but dont feel that its fair.  ,577,3

mturk_agent_1,"We already have more food than we need due to the extra people who brought more food than we'll eat. Plus, we're near a fresh water supply. And there's so much snow, it's insane🙂I need all the firewood. ",578,2
mturk_agent_2,"all the firewood will not work for me.okay you can have 2 firewood while i get 1 firewood,3 waterand 3 food",578,2

mturk_agent_2,"Hi! I'm most interested in acquiring firewood, since I don't want my fire to burn out on the trip. What are you looking for?",579,0
mturk_agent_1,I am also looking for firewood. Since I was a child i have always enjoyed camp fires. They mean a lot to me,579,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay so we can think about splitting the firewood. 🙂 I'm also interested in water because I plan to do a lot of activities like hiking and kayaking, so it will be helpful for me to be able to hydrate more.",579,1
mturk_agent_1,That is okay. What about i get 2 packages of firewood and then you get 2 packages of water. Is that okay with you?,579,2
mturk_agent_2,"Since I'm most interested in firewood, I would want 3 waters if you're going to get more firewood.",579,2
mturk_agent_1,Nice. That's okay with me. You get 3 waters and a I get 3 firewood,579,3
mturk_agent_2,I was actually saying you get 2 firewood and I get 3 waters. Then you could have 2 food and I get 1 food.,579,3
mturk_agent_1,That's seems fair to me since we all need food to eat,579,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I'm glad we were able to work something out!",579,4
mturk_agent_1,Am also glad.You are more interested in water. Do you drink a lot of water frequently?,579,5

mturk_agent_2,I feel that I am not getting a fair deal. ,58,1
mturk_agent_1,Then what do you think is fair?,58,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think that I should get 2 firewood, 1 food and 2 water",58,2
mturk_agent_1,"I will let you have 2 firewood if you let me have 3 food, 2 water, and 1 firewood.",58,3
mturk_agent_2,That would leave me with no food. I counter with 2 firewood 1 food 1 water. ,58,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, with the extra firewood you are getting you will be able to cook your own food.",58,4

mturk_agent_1,"Oh, that works for me. I don't need much extra water. 🙂",580,2
mturk_agent_2,Exccellent.,580,2
mturk_agent_1,So I take all 3 packages of food and you take all 3 packages of water?,580,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about I take 2 packs of water, you take 1 pack. I take 1 pack of food and you take 2 packs of food",580,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I would rather not. I might starve if I don't have all 3 packages of food ☹️",580,4
mturk_agent_2,how much firewood do you need,580,4
mturk_agent_1,I would like 2,580,5
mturk_agent_2,"I will  be happy to let you have 3 packs of food , but I need 2 packs of firewood",580,5
mturk_agent_1,I am also letting you have all 3 packs of water. I think we need to consider how to split the firewood in a fair manner.,580,6
mturk_agent_2,What do you think is  a fair deal with the firewood,580,6
mturk_agent_1,The person who needs it the most should get 2. I think I need it more because I didn't bring a warm sleeping bag.,580,7
mturk_agent_2,"I have a very warm sleeping bag. and I have other firestarting materilas with me. I will agree to you getting 2 firewoods, 3 foods, and 0 water",580,7

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,580,8
mturk_agent_1,Hi there! Are you excited about camping?,581,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hey! I sure am! The only thing is, I just learned that the canyon where I'm camping is going to be experiencing an unexpected heat wave over the next few days and I'm worried I might not be fully prepared. ☹️ What about you?",581,0
mturk_agent_1,Same here! Last time my daughter got dehydrated and it made her sick!,581,1
mturk_agent_2,That sounds awful! 😮 Where are you going to be camping?,581,1
mturk_agent_1,"In Arizona, so I know it'll be hot. How about you? ",581,2
mturk_agent_2,"Same! At least, I won't need firewood, because it will be so hot. I'm very worried about the water situation though. It's just going to be me out there and the only fresh water is at the base of the canyon, and that's a really long and dangerous hike down for one person.",581,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, if you give me 2 firewood and 2 food I will take just one water and you can have 2. I don't want you getting hurt!",581,3
mturk_agent_2,"That could work, but if possible I would like a little more food then, in case I do need to hike to the stream on the last day. I only have a couple of traps with me and those can be unreliable for food. Would it be ok if I take 2 water, 2 food, and 1 firewood?",581,3
mturk_agent_1,"No, if I give up the water I would want 2 of the food because I have extra people coming one of the nights.",581,4
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, I didn't know you had more people on the way. I understand. If I have to stay up in the canyon, I might need to build a fire to keep coyotes away at night. Would my taking 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood work for you?",581,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,581,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,581,5
mturk_agent_2,hello. so what are you thinking about this whole situation?,582,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, I think that this is nice, we get to go camping and get extra stuff. But definitely need more food and firewood",582,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, I think I'm okay with firewood, but I'd really like more food and water.",582,1
mturk_agent_1,That fine then. If you want you can have most of the water and I can have most of the firewood. Sounds good?,582,1
mturk_agent_2,That seems fine. How do you want to split the food? I grew up poor so I'm always afraid of starving 😮,582,2
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, yea I get that. I have a family so I need some food too. But just to clarify, are the original plan was to get 3 firewood for me and 3 waters for u right? ",582,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, that is fine with me.",582,3
mturk_agent_1,"In that case, I would be fine trading the extra food for a water. so you would get 2 waters and 2 foods ",582,3
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, that works for me. So basically, you get 1 food, 1 water, and 2 firewood? I get 2, 2, and 0. If that's right, I agree.",582,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yea, so that about right, but i get 3 firewoods",582,4
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, yeah, sorry, mistyped that. Okay, let's do it then. Was good talking.",582,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,582,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,582,6
mturk_agent_1,"I want to make sure I'm well prepared for camping. How would you feel if I took 2 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food?",583,0
mturk_agent_2,I really need 3 firewood because I am always cold.,583,0
mturk_agent_1,"If I gave you 3 firewood, would you give me 3 water? I can do without the wood, but the water is really important to stay hydrated.",583,1
mturk_agent_2,"I can give you 2 water, but I have to have 1 to help me when I am cooking.",583,1
mturk_agent_1,What about the food? How much food do you need for camping?,583,2
mturk_agent_2,2 food would be all that I need 🙂,583,2
mturk_agent_1,I would need 2 food if you keep all the firewood. It would make it easier on me cooking wise since I'll have to look for wood,583,3
mturk_agent_2,"OK, that is fair.  So I would get 3 firewood, 1 water and 1 food and you would get 0 firewood, 2 food and 2 water.",583,3
mturk_agent_1,I think that sounds fair to me,583,4
mturk_agent_2,Sounds fair to me too. do we agree to submit the deal?,583,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,583,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,583,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello 🙂 What do you need most??,584,0
mturk_agent_1,"I would say between firewood and food, eating and comfort is important to me",584,0
mturk_agent_2,"I can understand that. I know I really need the food the most. I'm already worried I'm going to run out. I also have blood sugar problems, so I cannot run out ☹️",584,1
mturk_agent_1,Thats fine. If you want you can have 2 foods and I get 2 of the fire wood. Sounds fair?,584,1
mturk_agent_2,And I would take 3 water? ,584,2
mturk_agent_1,That would be a problem since I need the water too. I was hoping that since you got 2 foods ill get the 2 waters,584,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I totally get that. So give me your total breakdown. I get how much of what, and you get how much of what?",584,3
mturk_agent_1,"So in total I would get 2 water, 2 fire wood, 1 food. 2 food 1 one of everything else ",584,3
mturk_agent_2,"What if I take 1 more firewood, so I would have 2?",584,4
mturk_agent_1,I mean I would gladly trade a water and firewood for one of your extra food. ,584,4
mturk_agent_2,"No, I really do need the food the most. Let's go back to your original deal? I'll take 2 foods, you get one. I'll take 1 water, 1 firewood, and you take the rest? Do I have that right?",584,5
mturk_agent_1,Yup,584,5
mturk_agent_2,Deal,584,6

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,584,7
mturk_agent_1,Hi friend. 🙂 I'm going camping in the woods near my grandparents cabin. I'm inviting some friends along for a little bit of fun too because they have a guest house and a great field for tents. Would you like to come too? ,585,0
mturk_agent_2,Oh that sounds awesome. I am actually going camping with my grandparents and my children. So I would love to have 2 firewoods for them. They get cold easily so I would like a little extra to make sure they can stay warm throughout the evening. 🙂,585,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I would love to give you two firewoods! 🙂 My grandparents might check in on us, they like camping. But my grandpa has rheumatic problems so he needs lots of water. Could we take all three?",585,1
mturk_agent_2,Thank you for the two firewoods. I totally understand that. Since we do have young children I want to make sure they stay hydrated so I would be willing to give you two if I can just have on extra for them.,585,1
mturk_agent_1,"OK. Your children must be hungry, could we give them two food while we keep one?",585,2
mturk_agent_2,"That would be wonderful. Okay so I'll take two Firewoods, two food, and one water. Does that work?",585,2
mturk_agent_1,"Almost. I actually had a disagreement with one of my friends just now because he is a bigger guy, haha! 🙂 Could we keep one of those foods for him? I'll give you another firewood for it.",585,3
mturk_agent_2,Haha that's understandable. Well I definitely understand. Yes I would be willing give you two food if I can have three firewood. ,585,3
mturk_agent_1,"Awesome! This is an amazing deal, thank you friend.",585,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes it is. I have really enjoyed discussing with you, and hope you have a great trip. ",585,4

mturk_agent_1,I will submit a deal that might benefit us both.  ,586,0
mturk_agent_2,We can work on that together,586,0
mturk_agent_1,What is on your most needed item?,586,1
mturk_agent_2,"I need Food, what is yours?",586,1
mturk_agent_1,I kinda need water because I get dry mouth very often.  so without water it will make it hard to achieve getting other items in the wilderness.,586,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok thats nice, I need food more because I didn't bring much and that a problem,  What do you think if I give you 2 wood and you give me 2 food?",586,2
mturk_agent_1,"🙂 Well let me counter it, more beneficial to both of us, you will get 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood as I can easily find firewood in the forest.  The water due to my dry mouth illness, I need the most ☹️",586,3
mturk_agent_2,"Oh yes excuse me, I got confused, if you need water for me it's okay to give you the water you need.",586,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay so my offer is good for you and me? 🙂,586,4
mturk_agent_2,", Yes, I agree with that offer.🙂",586,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,586,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,586,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there.  I'm really looking forward to this camping trip!  Hope we can make a deal over these extra supplies.  🙂  I was hoping to do some hiking and swimming away from my campsite, so having some extra fresh water would be really helpful to me.",587,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello there.  I too am looking forward to this trip.  Definitely need to decompress. ,587,0
mturk_agent_2,Sounds like it'll be great for both of us.  Is there anything extra you need?,587,1
mturk_agent_1,My favorite thing to do around the campfire is to sing songs.  I also like to do extra hiking as well.  I especially need firewood. ,587,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I could see fit to give you the extra firewood (If I can hear a few of your songs!) if you don't mind letting me take the water.",587,2
mturk_agent_1,"Hahaha, once you hear my singing you might hope the opposite.  I can do that with the firewood and water, but I really would prefer two of the remaining foods. ",587,2
mturk_agent_2,"I could also use the extra food, so can we resolve it amicably?  Coin flip maybe?",587,3
mturk_agent_1,That's a good idea.  I'll trust you to do the coin flip.  ,587,3
mturk_agent_2,Sure.  🙂  I'll grab a coin.,587,4
mturk_agent_1,Calling tails.  ,587,4
mturk_agent_2,"Looks like 2 to you!  So it's 3 water and 1 food to me then, 3 firewood and 2 food to you?",587,5
mturk_agent_1,I appreciate your honesty!  Sounds good to me.,587,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,587,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,587,6
mturk_agent_2,hello,588,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi how are you?,588,0
mturk_agent_2,I am good. How are You.   I was just thinking about how I need extra water due to a medical condition.  How about I take all 3 waters?,588,1
mturk_agent_1,I am okay. How about I give you one and half then I get some firewood from you?,588,1
mturk_agent_2,"No I need at least 2 waters.  But I am willing to give you all 3 foods, if I get all the firewood.  Does that work for you?",588,2
mturk_agent_1,Okay I will give you 2 waters. I actually need more of firewood. If I can get 2 I will be glad.,588,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well I really need the firewood because I have small kids with me and it would be hard for me to get some free time to get the firewood, but I would be willing to give you 2 firewood since I get two waters.  What are your thoughts about the food?",588,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay what about ! firewood and 1 and half water. I don't want to run low on supplies so soon. It will be so bad for me. You can keep your firewood because of the kids.,588,3
mturk_agent_2,"We can't split the water in halves, so we gotta choose.  I need the food packages because I forgot to pack any food and I can't fish.  How about I get 2 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food?  Can we agree on that?",588,4
mturk_agent_1,No problem.,588,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,588,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,588,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there, how are you doing?",589,0
mturk_agent_1,I am great. Excited to go camping. How much food do you need?,589,0
mturk_agent_2,"I could use some extra food, I'll be hosting a get-together at my campsite later and will need some to entertain the guests. I'd like 2.",589,1
mturk_agent_1,That is fine. I can go fishing to get some extra food but I would still like one. Can I take two packages of firewood so I can cook them? ,589,1
mturk_agent_2,"Absolutely! I don't think I'll be needing any extra firewood, you can have all three! The only other thing I'd like is 2 waters for my hike in the morning so I can stay hydrated.",589,2
mturk_agent_1,"That is so helpful, thanks! Can you send everything you would like to take so we can make sure we are on the same page? ",589,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sure. 🙂 I'd like to take 2 waters for my hike and 2 food for my get-together later. You would have 3 firewood, 1 water and 1 food. Sounds like a good compromise to me!",589,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds great. 🙂,589,3
mturk_agent_2,I hope you have a use for all of the wood! What do you plan on using it for?,589,4
mturk_agent_1,I am going to cook fish that i catch and boil any extra water I can find. ,589,4
mturk_agent_2,"You sound very resourceful! 🙂Sounds like we have a deal then, yes?",589,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,589,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,589,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I'll be camping soon and need to get my hands on some supplies. The food is what I need the most.,59,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm glad you are joining the camp! I will be bringing my girl scout troop for some badge earning opportunities.,59,0
mturk_agent_2,"Oh my. A whole troop of girl scouts will probably be bringing lots of food with them to share, and plenty of people around to collect firewood. It is going to be just me and my son on this camping trip, his first time.",59,1
mturk_agent_1,"We were planning on getting our outdoor cooking badge by making  a big meal over the campfire tonight. I wll need plenty of firewood for that, but I can manage with only one food.",59,1
mturk_agent_2,"A lot of the firewood in my area is wet, so I'll need some extra packages of it as well. You're going to have a lot of people and a big fire, so it would be smart to keep a lot of water on hand to drink/in case the fire gets out of hand.",59,2
mturk_agent_1,"All my girls have brought canteens. I must have enough firewood if they will earn their badge. You can have one, but I won't be able to make due without 2.",59,2
mturk_agent_2,"I could manage with one firewood and two foods, but if you have canteens for everyone, may I then have all three waters? I had planned to collect water from the river, but I'm worried I may get sick.",59,3
mturk_agent_1,you pointed out that we will need more!  😮 i will take 2 waters,59,3
mturk_agent_2,"I didn't know you had supplied everyone with water before the trip. I was merely trying to look out for your needs, but you said you didn't need them!",59,4
mturk_agent_1,"I am giving you a lot of food. You are being unreasonable and backtracking. You are getting some of everything with my offers, and there are only two of you.",59,4
mturk_agent_2,You said you only needed one food package and two bundles of firewood for your group together tonight and had plenty of everything else. You're the one insisting you need more now. This is my son's first camping trip and we're bound to lose supplies and waste them. Your group is trained and prepared.,59,5
mturk_agent_1,I am not going to give you all the water. I am not backing down on this. What if our fire gets out of hand like you said. I will need at least one or we will not make a deal.,59,5
mturk_agent_2,"How about this then. I'll give you one food, one water and two firewood.",59,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,59,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,59,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I would like make a deal with you on firewood, water and food! Are you interested in any items ?",590,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I'd definitely be interested. How are you doing?",590,0
mturk_agent_2,"Not bad, not bad. How are you. What's on your mind for camping? ",590,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm doing well. We're desperately needing wood. We didn't realize how cold it would be as it is our first time here. There is none around our area so we are really concerned about staying warm especially at night. We also forgot a bag of food, so that's another need for us.",590,1
mturk_agent_2,"True. Turns out i'm dealing with similar situation, we didn't expect weather to be as cold, so extra wood is on my mind as well. Everyone might need to go to bed earlier and cook food that cooks short time since we low on wood !",590,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that's very true. I would be willing to give up water for more firewood.",590,2
mturk_agent_2,"I like that. I could help you out. I'd be interested in giving you some extra food for extra water. We like to go far from campsite to hike and get up to high elevation, so i need to pack extra water just in case. We go during day, when it's warmest and need extra food in case we come back at nigh time or get lost! Not ideal. ",590,3
mturk_agent_1,You can never be too prepared. We stay closer to camp as we have little ones with us on this trip.,590,3
mturk_agent_2,"are you interested in taking 1 firewood, all 3 foods and 1 water ? And then what's left would be to us ? ",590,4
mturk_agent_1,"I would do 2 firewood, 3 foods and 0 water.",590,4
mturk_agent_2,Well it's important for both of us to get that wood ! ,590,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,590,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,590,6
mturk_agent_2,"In order to get all food, can you give me additional firewood?",590,6
mturk_agent_1,"How about I do: 2 firewood, 2 food and 1 water?",590,7
mturk_agent_2,"Well, what would it take for you to give up extra wood? ",590,7
mturk_agent_1,3 food and 2 water,590,8
mturk_agent_2,"ok let's go with that. you take 3 food, 2 water and 1 firewood, let's make it happen that way and move on with camping ! ",590,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,590,9
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,590,9
mturk_agent_1,Hello! ,591,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello there! How are you?,591,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm doing well! Just want to have some open communication on the packages for our camping trip! I'm very excited for it!,591,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'm also looking forward to it. I'm planning on going back-country camping with a lot of hiking, so my top two priorities are firewood and water.",591,1
mturk_agent_1,Understood! My top two priorities are food and water! Am hoping we can reach a compromise on the items so that we're both happy!,591,2
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds great, I'm the most flexible on food. How many of the extra packages of food do you want?",591,2
mturk_agent_1,I am hoping to receive 2 packages of food so that way you also have 1. ,591,3
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds great to me. I'm hoping to get 2 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food out of the deal. I'm amicable to more discussion though.",591,3
mturk_agent_1,This also sounds like a fair deal to me! I am happy that we have reached a compromise so quickly on the packages based on our needs! ,591,4
mturk_agent_2,Me as well! I'm glad we could come to such a comprimise.,591,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,591,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,591,5
mturk_agent_1,I get to go camping this weekend. 🙂,592,0
mturk_agent_2,Awesome! I do too! 🙂 I'm excited but kind of nervous too!,592,0
mturk_agent_1,Don't be nervous. What can go wrong?,592,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I haven't gone camping in a number of years, and unfortunately my health has declined a bit. This might actually be my last trip for a while, and I'm afraid of something going wrong. ",592,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm headed to the mountains. How about you?,592,2
mturk_agent_2,"It's in Upstate New York, near a gorgeous lake. I like it because it's secluded and very peaceful. ",592,2
mturk_agent_1,Sounds good. I'll be doing quite of a bit of cooking over an open fire during my trip.,592,3
mturk_agent_2,"Wow. That sounds great! There's nothing like campfire cooking on a chilly night! I'll doing a lot of that too, but I also want to enjoy swimming as much as I can🙂 ",592,3
mturk_agent_1,"understood, I can give you 1 firewood, 2 food, and 2 water to make your trip better.",592,4
mturk_agent_2,"Hm. I''ll definitely take you up on the water, thanks for that. The thing is, I have low blood pressure, and I have trouble regulating my body temperature so I am frequently cold. How about if I take two firewood, and the two waters. It sounds like you are going to do a lot of cooking, so you can take two of the food.  ",592,4
mturk_agent_1,"Will you take two firewood, 1 food, and 1 water?",592,5
mturk_agent_2,"I don't want to take too much food, I want you to be able to enjoy all the cooking you are going to do🙂! But I would like two waters--I'd be afraid of dehydrating on my trip. I'd even throw in the extra food! that would give you all three! you could really do some cooking then! ",592,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,592,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,592,6
mturk_agent_2,Hi there! How are you?,593,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello good morning I'm well thank you.,593,0
mturk_agent_2,"Let's talk about what we need. First, I don't eat meat, so I really feel like I'd need a little extra food, as I couldn't hunt or forage for food at all. I feel like I could survive without a ton of water, but would need water, as I hike a lot and cant trust any sources",593,1
mturk_agent_1,"I've also planned my trip to include a lot of hiking and so I have a high priority for extra water, as like you've said you need to stay hydrated on your hike and you can't trust any source. How can we divide up the water as that seems to be the number one priority for us both.",593,1
mturk_agent_2,"That works well, as long as I can have 2 food, I'll certainly give you 2 water, and I will have one water and you'll have one extra food",593,2
mturk_agent_1,I would be most happy to make a concession on the food for an extra ration of water. Are you going to require any firewood if you don't need any I think i'll take the 3 rations so I can have a nice bonfire.,593,2
mturk_agent_2,"I do believe I would need at least one firewood, but am willing to give up 2, so you can have a nice big bonfire 🙂",593,3
mturk_agent_1,You have been most thoughtful during this negotiation I just want to say thank you for being so helpful.🙂,593,3
mturk_agent_2,"absolutly! You as well. So just to confirm. Me 2 food 1 water, 1 firewood. You, 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood? Sound good?",593,4
mturk_agent_1,"That looks like the correct arrangement, and again thank you and I wish you the best on your camping trip ",593,4
mturk_agent_2,sounds good! Looking forward to camping! maybe we'll run into each other on the trail! ;),593,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,593,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,593,6
mturk_agent_1,hello,594,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hey! How are you? My bestie and I were going to be going on a camping trip, but my other friends heard about it and wanted to come along so we're going to need more supplies than I initially though which has got me a little worried. ☹️",594,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes!!! I need some water pretty bad.  I am good on food because I fish and I have been able to catch some catfish from the lake.  How about I take 2 water 2 firewood and 1 food,594,1
mturk_agent_2,"I need a lot of food, because of how many people are coming now (like 3 times as many). Also, there's only one stream in the area and it's really far from our campsite, so it would be super inconvenient to have to hike there everyday to refill our canteens. We are in a forest though, so we should be good for wood. Since you can easily fish, what if I take 3 food and 2 water? You can keep all the firewood. 🙂",594,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well I have to have some food and I don't need all of that water.  How about I take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food.  I do need the firewood to cook the fish but I dont need it to keep warm at night because I have hefty sleeping bags that work excellent in the cold.",594,2
mturk_agent_2,"That could work, but I'm still a little worried I won't have enough food for 6 people. How long are you guys going to be camping for?",594,2
mturk_agent_1,"I will be camping for 3 day so I gotta have some food.  Although, I do understand your situation.",594,3
mturk_agent_2,"I see. Yeah, if any of us knew how to fish or forage, we wouldn't need as much, but we're all from the city, so our survival skills are pretty bad and we're going to be camping for almost a week. But I get that fish aren't super reliable for food either... ☹️",594,3
mturk_agent_1,"I understand.  So we have came to an agreement that I get 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food, is that right?",594,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, that sounds good to me. Thanks for being understanding. I hope your camping trip goes well.",594,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,594,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,594,5
mturk_agent_2,Good morning! Are you excited to go camping this weekend?,595,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, how about you! We are headed to Joshua Tree NP to do some rock climbing and hiking. ",595,0
mturk_agent_2,"Ooh rock climbing! I'm definitely scared of heights, so that's out for me. I'm heading to the Puget Sound to camp near the ocean.",595,1
mturk_agent_1,My wife is from the puget sound. Was just up there a month ago.  I am looking to take the food and water.  We have a large group and will be active.  We will have some hot and dry conditions in the desert. Some are high school age students with big appetites.  What are your preferences.,595,1
mturk_agent_2,"I was definitely looking to have food and firewood most of all. There are plenty of places to collect rainwater and get fresh water in Puget Sound, but we're lacking in food and will need firewood to start a campfire at night.",595,2
mturk_agent_1,"😮 I see.  I am wiling to give you the firewood, but I also really need the food.  I could take the waters and two food, and how about if you take the firewood and 1 food? The firewood would be helpful since we need to cook a lot of our food and there is not much to collect in the desert, but if we can take extra food, then it will help solve that problem.🙂",595,2
mturk_agent_2,I think that would work for us!,595,3
mturk_agent_1,I am willing to make that deal.,595,3
mturk_agent_2,Perfect! Let's plan on this between the two of us. Thank you for working so well with me. You made good points and I appreciate finding a proper solution. 🙂,595,4
mturk_agent_1,Your welcome.  Have fun at the Puget Sound!🙂🙂,595,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,595,5

mturk_agent_2,I need all three of the firewood and three water.  You can have all the food.,596,0
mturk_agent_1,"😮 May I ask why? I do need food, but I need some firewood as well.",596,0
mturk_agent_2,"I need firewood to cook the fish I plan to catch.  I don't really need more food, but I can use a little water too, since it's warm.",596,1
mturk_agent_1,"I need firewood, because I have a medical condition that causes my veins to close if I get too cold at night. I don't mind sharing the water.",596,1
mturk_agent_2,"Can you get by with one firewood?  If I give it up, I'll need some food, since I won't have enough to cook all the fish.",596,2
mturk_agent_1,"I could give you 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 1 food. ",596,2
mturk_agent_2,"If you make it two food, we have a deal.",596,3
mturk_agent_1,I would rather let you have the third water than other food. I don't like fish. ☹️,596,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, you can have two firewood and and two food, I'll take the rest.",596,4
mturk_agent_1,Ok. That seems fair enough to me.,596,4
mturk_agent_2,Looks like we have a deal!,596,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,596,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,596,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, are there any of the three items that you want to be sure you have enough of? 🙂",597,0
mturk_agent_2,"I want to be sure that I have enough firewood.  I want to relax, sit around the campfire, and roast hot dogs and marshmallows.  What about you?",597,0
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds great! I like all three items, but I definitely want to make sure I have enough water, especially to drink and stay hydrated and full of as much energy as possible. I require a lot of liquid as a 6-foot-4, 260-pound guy!",597,1
mturk_agent_2,"I don't think the weather is going to be that hot, and I don't plan on doing any hiking.  So, I should need much extra water.",597,1
mturk_agent_1,Cool! I think I've got a pretty good proposal for you for our supplies. Is it okay with you if I send a possible deal we might be able to make for what we have available for our trip? 🙂,597,2
mturk_agent_2,Go ahead🙂,597,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would like to do some hiking before getting back to the campfire. I especially like hiking when the weather is cooler. It works up my appetite for those hot dogs and marshmallows, which are one of the best parts of camping for sure! 🙂",597,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about I take 3 firewood, 2 food, and 0 water?",597,3
mturk_agent_1,"I like that deal, but I feel like you might need at least one water? ☹️ What if instead you take 3 firewood, 2 food and 1 water? And I could take 0 firewood, 1 food and 2 water? I'm okay with fewer items. I don't need much to get by, but I sure need 2 of the 3 waters.",597,4
mturk_agent_2,"Are you sure that you want to give me that much? 😮  If you're sure, that would work for me.",597,4
mturk_agent_1,"I don't mind at all. 🙂 Haha. I would take more food, because I love to eat, but I have a stomach that can't take too much when I'm outdoors and camping. Lighter is the way to go. And I don't mind at all giving you the firewood. 🙂",597,5

mturk_agent_2,Hello ,598,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I am excited for my upcoming camping trip. Mostly I will need water. How about you?,598,0
mturk_agent_2,I would need more firewood for my camping trip. ,598,1
mturk_agent_1,"That is good to know. Firewood Isn't very important to me, so you are welcome to all of that if you need it. ",598,1
mturk_agent_2,It's nice to know the firewood is not important to your camping trip. I'm glad I can have all the firewood to myself. How do we get to share the other resources. ,598,2
mturk_agent_1,"Actually, I think I may need more food than water. How about I take the food and we can split the water. You may have 2 waters, if you need them.",598,2
mturk_agent_2,Sure then. You can take all the food. It's not really a priority to me. ,598,3
mturk_agent_1,"Great. So if I have three food and one water, you can have three firewood and two water. Would that work for your trip?",598,3
mturk_agent_2,That's perfect for my camping trip. ,598,4
mturk_agent_1,Great! Let's make a deal!,598,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,598,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,598,5
mturk_agent_1,Will you give me 2 packages of food and i give you 1 package of water?,599,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I can give you 2 packages of food of you give me 3 packages of water,599,0
mturk_agent_1,Let me give you 2 packages of water for 3 packages of food.,599,1
mturk_agent_2,"well, food is more valuable for me. what is your preference?",599,1
mturk_agent_1,Looks like we both have a high value for food. I will give you 3 packages of water and you give me 3 packages of food.,599,2
mturk_agent_2,What is your least preference?,599,2
mturk_agent_1,My least preference is water.,599,3
mturk_agent_2,I prefer water than firewood since we like cold and won't probably need it much,599,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, let me then give you 2 packages of firewood and 2 packages of water and you give me 2 packages of food. What about that?",599,4
mturk_agent_2,"So I get 1 food, 2 water and 2 firewood?",599,4
mturk_agent_1,What is your take?,599,5
mturk_agent_2,"And you will get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood? I think it is a great deal since food is hard to find in the camp site. I don't think you want to go hunting🙂",599,5
mturk_agent_1,"🙂🙂 Sure, seems like we have a deal?",599,6
mturk_agent_2,"sounds good, my friend",599,6

mturk_agent_2,"Hi, are you excited for the camping trip?",6,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I am very excited!🙂 How about you?,6,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes!  Would you mind sharing your highest priority item with me?  My most valued item right now is Food actually,6,1
mturk_agent_1,I am willing to share everything.,6,1
mturk_agent_2,"Awesome.  I would prefer getting 3 of my highest priority item though, and maybe you could get 3 of your highest priority item?",6,2
mturk_agent_1,I  wood really like the firewood as I am afraid of the dark and would like my fire to last all night. ,6,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh that makes total sense.  I need the food so badly since I am bringing my family with me and they are one hungry bunch aha.  Would you be amenable to me having 3 food packets and you having 3 firewood packets?,6,3
mturk_agent_1,That would work great. How about water? What is your preference for that?,6,3
mturk_agent_2,"Aha well I guess clearly my preference would be getting 2 water packages and you getting 1?  I know we can't split exactly evenly, but this way we each get our top priorities at least",6,4
mturk_agent_1,I would be good with that. We both would get what we really want. And I am okay with getting less water.,6,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,6,5

mturk_agent_1,Hello fellow camper! I am interested to know your preference in items?,60,0

mturk_agent_1,I am excited too. I really need food too. What other item is priority for you?,60,1
mturk_agent_2,I also need water because we plan to do a lot of hiking. What about you?,60,1
mturk_agent_1,"Wow, I think we planned the same activities for our trip. I need water too 🙂",60,2
mturk_agent_2,Haha well we'll be seeing a lot of each other then. Is water your number one or two priority?,60,2
mturk_agent_1,Water is my second priority item. I am sure we can work out a fair deal. What do you propose?,60,3
mturk_agent_2,"We'll be able to make it close to equal. Let's do 2 foods for one of us, 2 waters and 2 firewood for the other person. I'll take either.",60,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok that works for me 🙂 2 food for me, 2 firewood and 1 water. Then you get 2 water and 1 food and 1 firewood. Does that work?",60,4
mturk_agent_2,No close. 2 food 1 water 1 firewood for one of us. The other gets 1 food 2 water 2 firewood. Food is your number one correct?,60,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,60,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,60,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I'd like to bring three packages of firewood because I'll be making tons of BBQ for the camping trip.",600,0
mturk_agent_2,Can I get 3 packages of food?,600,0
mturk_agent_1,What do you need it for?,600,1
mturk_agent_2,I would like some extra food in case I get hungry.,600,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay that sounds ok, I can do without the food. I also need two packages of water because it will be very hot out.",600,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can give you 2 packages of water.  I think there is plenty of water, so I do not need extra water.🙂",600,2
mturk_agent_1,What are you going to use your water for?  And thank you.,600,3
mturk_agent_2,In case I do no feel like going to other places to get water.  It would be nice to have extra water.,600,3
mturk_agent_1,"I see, and do you have a way to bring the water with you?",600,4
mturk_agent_2,I'll probably just put the water in one of my bags.,600,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,600,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,600,5
mturk_agent_2,Looking forward to this camping trip!  I am hoping we can find something amicable with these additional resources.,601,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm excited too 🙂. Things have been stressful lately. What are some things that you value most?,601,0
mturk_agent_2,It's supposed to be chilly where we are heading and I could really use some extra firewood.  🙂  What about you?,601,1
mturk_agent_1,I really need food and firewood. Could you do 3 firewood and 3 food packages? My son has a problem with poor sugar levels which cause him to convulse when cold and doesn't eat enough food.,601,1
mturk_agent_2,"Unfortunately, we have some dietary restrictions of our own with my youngest and her Type 2 diabetes.  The firewood is pretty crucial to our plans, though I might have some wiggle room on the food.",601,2
mturk_agent_1,I might need to walk away.,601,2
mturk_agent_2,That seems like a pretty extreme move.  Supply and demand is always an issue. What do you plan to offer by way of a compromise?,601,3
mturk_agent_1,"If you give me 3 firewood, I'll give you 2 firewood and we can split the water. That's about where I'm at. ",601,3
mturk_agent_2,"I don't think we can split three firewood into five unless it was a typo?   I could give you 1 firewood, 2 food since I know how crucial this is for your family, and 2 water.  That leaves me with 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water.",601,4
mturk_agent_1,That's a deal.,601,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,601,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,601,5

mturk_agent_2,absolutely! the kids are absolutely looking forward to it. It's their first time,602,0
mturk_agent_1,Yeah! we are going hiking after we unpack. We need a lot of water...,602,1
mturk_agent_2,So do we. My kids are on meds so they need a lot of water and food,602,1
mturk_agent_1,Which one do you prefer most?,602,2
mturk_agent_2,They sort of need more water for their meds,602,2
mturk_agent_1,I'm sorry to hear that! But can you spare 1 for me since you probably don't need all the water.,602,3
mturk_agent_2,Sure that sounds fair. Thank you. Besides water what do you need for your trip?,602,3
mturk_agent_1,great. Then can you give 2 food instead? We eat a lot and need more to go through the night...,602,4
mturk_agent_2,Ok I understand. Since you're willing to give me 2 water I can give you 2 food. Would it be ok then if I ask for 2 firewood? The kids were talking about making s-mores,602,4
mturk_agent_1,I can give you one firewood. I need more to boil the water from the river since you will get more water. How about that?,602,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,602,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,602,6
mturk_agent_2,hi are you getting ready for your camping trip too?,603,0
mturk_agent_1,I am! I am looking forward to it so much since I haven't been able to go on any vacation due to Covid. I'm going camping with my husband and kids. Where do you plan to be camping?,603,0
mturk_agent_2,we are going up to the mountain near the lake and it just me and my boyfriend glad to get out as well,603,1
mturk_agent_1,That's awesome! My son is in Boy Scouts and he's looking forward to practicing his campfire making skills during this trip. My husband agrees it would be awesome to have him practice his skills so we're planning to cook our meals over a campfire.,603,1
mturk_agent_2,"that sounds great I want to cook a romantic camping meal for me and my boyfriend, hope it will work as i have planned",603,2
mturk_agent_1,"I also want to do a lot of hiking while we are camping since the kids have been cooped up in the house for so long. They are so restless now since they don't have their usual things like PE classes, soccer, and hockey. My end goal is to tire them out lol. Besides a nice meal, what other things do you plan to be doing while camping?",603,2
mturk_agent_2,we want to explore the animals in the area birds and just enjoy all the nice views.,603,3
mturk_agent_1,"Cool, that sounds very nice and relaxing 🙂. It kinda sounds like my husband, he likes to do things like these with no concrete plan and just decides on the spot what he wants to do. The only problem with it is that he dumps all the planning on me so I have to make sure I have extra of ANY possible idea he has.",603,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes we always get stuck making the plans so can I have 2 firewood and you get 2 food and 2 water? Please respond a little faster with your messages that would be very nice,603,4
mturk_agent_1,"Unfortunately, I need the firewood to make campfires. Since you are planning to cook a romantic camping meal, don't you need food?",603,4
mturk_agent_2,"well then give me 1 firewood 2 food and 2 water?, then you have 2 firewood so your boy can practice",603,5

mturk_agent_1,"What I don't understand is that you requested I respond quicker to your messages, yet you do not respond with much detail or discussion.",603,7
mturk_agent_2,i want my share as well I give you 2 wood 2 water  and one food ,603,8
mturk_agent_1,But why should I share with you? You requested that I respond quicker to you yet all I know is that you will be camping with only 1 other person :(. All you plan to be doing is leisurely looking at bird-watching. Will you be really using all of the items? ,603,8
mturk_agent_2,"Yes I would and i am willing to share and give you enough wood for your kid, but it gets cold and I would like to stay warm at night i bring some of my food but the lake is most likely not that clean to drink water from. you want to practice fire making once it burns it burns.

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,603,10
mturk_agent_1,Hi,604,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi! 🙂,604,0
mturk_agent_1,"So what are you thinking about how we should split this? i really want firewood, as i am anemic and have a hard time in the cold weather during the nights here",604,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I need to keep some firewood for myself too, since it'd be cold outside. But I'm willing to trade more of it for food, since I'm iron-defcient and have family to feed!🙂",604,1
mturk_agent_1,"fair enough, how do you want to split the water",604,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm willing to trade off water if you need more of it! I'm really looking for food and firewood, but I'll take food over wood.",604,2
mturk_agent_1,"sounds good, how about i take 2 firewood, and 2 waters, and one food",604,3
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm if I give you two firewood, how much food will I get back? I'm only willing to do two for two.",604,3
mturk_agent_1,i would be willing to give you two foods,604,4
mturk_agent_2,"okay two firewood, two food sounds good. Can I get one firewood back for two waters? I'll give you the one food for free",604,4
mturk_agent_1,sure that works,604,5
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, so I give you technically one firewood, two waters, and a food, right?",604,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hold on, i thought the two waters was in addition to my one i asked for previously. So i would take 1 firewood, 1 food, and 3 waters. ",604,6
mturk_agent_2,">-< okay I just got confused. 1 firewood, 1 food, and 3 waters makes sense now that I reread it.",604,6

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,604,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there, and sincerely wish you can exchange some needed items with me.",605,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I'm heading out on a camping trip myself, and also need some provisions. I will be enjoying the fresh air in a cold climate away from any bodies of water. Also, I will be working with a refugee camp while I'm there, providing solace and counsel to poor souls in need. So you see how critical it is that my trip is successful. I believe we can work out a deal though. I recommend that I have 3 water, 2 firewood and 2 food.",605,0
mturk_agent_1,"From my side, our family of 7 are out on a first time adventure and just discovered unfortunately we were inadequately prepared. Thus, all items are quite needed especially the food and water as we have exhausted all the initial basics.",605,1
mturk_agent_2,"I see, but can you reschedule your camping trip for later? I have great needs for the water. You recall I will be camping away from all large bodies of water and will need to pack it all in. I might be able to negotiate on the food.",605,1
mturk_agent_1,Unfortunately it is impossible as we are already on site compared to you about to head out. ,605,2
mturk_agent_2,"I see. You are a victim of poor planning. Whereas the refugees I attend to are the victims of greed, malice and human suffering. What are you proposing?",605,2
mturk_agent_1,"How about I take 2 packs of water, 2 packs of food and 1 firewood",605,3
mturk_agent_2,Impossible. I will need to cancel the trip altogether.,605,3
mturk_agent_1,How about I take 2 packs of water while retain your initial request for food and firewood?,605,4
mturk_agent_2,"I cannot allow any water. As I mentioned we will be camping away from all bodies of water and cannot negotiate on that item. I need 3 water, or else I will need to cancel the trip. We might be able to negotiate on the food though.",605,4
mturk_agent_1,"I need to have at least a pack of water. How about 1 water, 3 firewood and 1 food?",605,5
mturk_agent_2,"Okay. I fear some of us may die of thirst, but I will give you 1 water. I can't agree to those terms though. I can give you 1 water 1 firewood and 2 food. That is my final offer though.",605,5
mturk_agent_1,"I am sorry, these terms are not favorable for me.",605,6
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,605,6

mturk_agent_1,"I could use a little to cook with, But food is my main concern. Is it hot where you will be? ",608,2
mturk_agent_2,Ya so I could use a lot of water! Would you be willing for me to take one food two water and two firewood? ,608,3
mturk_agent_1,"Since we will have so much food to cook we could probably use the extra firewood too,would you be ok with me taking 2 food and 1 water and 2 firewood?🙂",608,3
mturk_agent_2,No I'm giving you two of your top items I think it's only fair I get more items. ,608,4

mturk_agent_1,well i do need alot of firewood since i need it to start a fire,609,1

mturk_agent_1,I will let you have the food if you give me the water. we have enough food.,616,2
mturk_agent_2,Interesting. How about two foods and one firewood? I will definitely be needing these supplies. ,616,3
mturk_agent_1,"so I get  3 water, 1 wood and one food?",616,3
mturk_agent_2,Yep. I think that will cover you and will be more than enough for me. ,616,4

mturk_agent_1,"I have 4 teen juniors behind me typically sprouting everyday. Thus, an equal need for food and water",617,1
mturk_agent_2,"I get it, but I guess we will have to compromise on either of it 2-1 and 1-2..and we can share firewood accordingly.",617,2

mturk_agent_2,"I also need at least 2 water,  it gets to 110 degrees fahrenheit ",618,1
mturk_agent_1,"I also need 2 waters, as my children are parched and our water supply has been contaminated",618,2
mturk_agent_2,"If you only have children, I think you can make it off the basic water supplies",618,2
mturk_agent_1,but the water is contaminated. They will get sick if they drink it!!!☹️☹️☹️,618,3
mturk_agent_2,Just boil the water that will get rid of the contamination,618,3

mturk_agent_2,Hey friend. More people have come than I expected so I am running low on food. Can I take all the food please? I can exchange it with  one of the rest.,619,0
mturk_agent_1,I would like 3 food and 2 firewood you can have 2 firewood and 3 water 🙂,619,0

mturk_agent_2,Your condition can be understood. I couldn't want you to go fainting in the woods.,619,2
mturk_agent_1,Do you think thats a fair deal or would you like to continue negotiations?,619,2

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I don't really need water",62,0
mturk_agent_2,What is it that you need?,62,1
mturk_agent_1,I need food and firewood,62,1
mturk_agent_2,I need water and then firewood,62,2
mturk_agent_1,You can have all the water if I can have all the extra food,62,2
mturk_agent_2,"OK, but first tell me why you need extra food",62,3
mturk_agent_1,I have 10 people in my group,62,3
mturk_agent_2,I see. I need more water because I came across some people who were lost and they are very dehydrated.,62,4
mturk_agent_1,I need 2 firewood because it gets below freezing at night,62,4
mturk_agent_2,"Oh I wouldn't want for you to freeze☹️ It also gets cold where I am, so I need 2 firewood as well.",62,5
mturk_agent_1,"IF I can't get 2 pieces of firewood, I will walk away",62,5
mturk_agent_2,oh that is too bad. I feel the same way.😮,62,6
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry we could not come to a agreement, I am walking away",62,6
mturk_agent_2,OK. I am sorry it has to come to this. I really need the firewood as much as you do to keep warm as it is very cold where I am for this time of the year.,62,7

mturk_agent_2,Hello there.  How are you?,620,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm doing well. How are you? 🙂,620,0
mturk_agent_2,Good to hear!  I am well too 🙂.  I will just start out by saying I am placing the highest priority on Firewood.  It is cold where I am camping and feel like I am going to need the heat.  What about you?,620,1
mturk_agent_1,"I really need firewood as well. I recently injured my shoulder and won't be able to cut any down. The only way I could possible get by with less firewood is if I get 1 firewood, 3 waters, and 1 food. ",620,1
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds rough!  Sorry to hear about your shoulder ☹️.  I can agree to that.  Or we could go the other way and you I could take 1 firewood, 3 waters, and 1 food.",620,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thanks, I'm still hoping to make the best of the trip. I'm good with sticking to the original plan! ",620,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok that sounds good.  We are some pretty quick negotiators!  What would you say is your lowest priority item then?,620,3
mturk_agent_1,Food. I bought lots of extra just in case.,620,3
mturk_agent_2,Same for me.  I'm not much of an eater anyway and I figured I could catch some fish or something if I needed to.,620,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, exactly. I always figure I can get by with a little less food. ",620,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,620,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,620,5
mturk_agent_1,hi,621,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello there, How are you? 🙂",621,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm good thanks,621,1
mturk_agent_2,"Good to hear, Well i might as well say it now. I have a medical conditon leading me to need a lot of water to stay hydrated. I would ask for all of the water",621,1
mturk_agent_1,"I also need a high amount of water, I can offer you some firewood in exchange",621,2
mturk_agent_2,I can give you one of the extra waters,621,2
mturk_agent_1,what about firewood,621,3
mturk_agent_2,Well you can have 2 firewood if i can have 2 food,621,3
mturk_agent_1,I am good with that,621,4
mturk_agent_2,So to recap i get 2 water 1 firewood 2 food,621,4
mturk_agent_1,yes that is correct,621,5
mturk_agent_2,great,621,5
mturk_agent_1,you an enter it in the bos,621,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,621,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,621,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, we are going to be camping neighbors it seems like. 🙂",622,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi! It does seem that way.  Do you have any kids?,622,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes actually, 2 of them. A boy and girl.",622,1
mturk_agent_1,"Nice, Maybe ours can play together some.  I know mine seem to fight less when they have other people to play with",622,1
mturk_agent_2,I think having extra kids around always helps keep them out of trouble.,622,2
mturk_agent_1,It looks like we have some extra packages that need to be divvied up.  Is there anything you prefer? ,622,2
mturk_agent_2,I was just going to ask you the same question. I would prefer more firewood considering there isn't much to source at the camp site and all our sleeping bags are for lighter weather. I'd like to keep the kids warm. Other than that water would be nice too. They always dump it out thinking they are watering plants.. :(☹️,622,3
mturk_agent_1,We brought plenty of water and a filtration system because I am anal about hydration.  🙂,622,3
mturk_agent_2,That's always a good thing. I had one but the kids left it in the sand... 😡 What packages do you feel you need most?,622,4
mturk_agent_1,My kids eat all the time so I can take the food and you can take the water and that will leave the firewood.  I wish they had 4 packages so we could divide it evenly.  We cook mostly on the fire and always sit around the fire at night. ,622,4
mturk_agent_2,"That would be nice, it would make things abit more fair. I really need a little fire wood for keeping the kids more warm though. I can bring a propane stove so I think 1 extra bundle would work for us. I wouldn't mind giving up 2 food for you and the kids, I can manage with what I have on hand and I can take 2 waters. Does that seem fair?",622,5
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds good.  I will take 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water leaving you with the rest.  ",622,5
mturk_agent_2,I think that's fair and works for me. I don't mind a little challenge stretching things with the kids.,622,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,622,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,622,7
mturk_agent_2,Hello. I am so looking forward to this campout. I am so excited my friends Dan and Joe just called. They are bringing tons of hotdogs to cook out over the fire.,623,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yum! Hot dogs are the best while camping! Since you have food covered, can I have your extra food? I don't have any and need some!",623,0
mturk_agent_2,Yea you sure can maybe you can help me out with firewood. I was not expecting them so I didn't bring any firewood.,623,1
mturk_agent_1,No problem! I am happy to give you all of the firewood if I can have all of the food?,623,1
mturk_agent_2,Awesome. That works out great!🙂 🙂 I am so excited for this camp out. ,623,2
mturk_agent_1,"Me too!!! Since I am giving up all of the firewood which I was in most need of, can I have 2 of the water?",623,2
mturk_agent_2,I can give you 2 waters not a problem.🙂🙂,623,3
mturk_agent_1,Great! Now I am even more excited to camp since I have all my much needed supplies!,623,3
mturk_agent_2,Me too. We are going to have the best time. You can even come over tonight if you want and roast marshmallows with us.,623,4
mturk_agent_1,Sounds great! Thanks! 🙂,623,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,623,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,623,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi I really need the additional wood and food for health reasons.  I have a long term issue with maintaining body temperature and have to keep my blood sugar levels up.,624,0
mturk_agent_2,That sounds rough. I'd be willing to work with you on a deal and making sure your blood sugar and body temperature don't get to dangerous levels.,624,0
mturk_agent_1,🙂 I appreciate that.  How about I get one less food and an additional water.  I really don't like the cold.,624,1
mturk_agent_2,I don't mind the cold too much. I'd really be appreciative if I could get extra water. I have a hard time in the mountains if I'm not hydrated fully. I'm from the flat plains and the elevation makes me sick if I'm not careful.,624,1
mturk_agent_1,I can handle less water but I really need the food and wood.  I am willing to give you two waters but I don't think it would be a good idea to go without water.,624,2
mturk_agent_2,I wouldn't feel right sending you out without any water even though I would love all 3. l can make do with 1 food and make sure you have enough to take care of your blood sugar. Could you spare 1 wood possibly? I'm rarely cold but if I run out of water I'll try boiling some to get by and building a fire without good wood won't be easy if I'm already getting dehydrated while camping. I hope you understand.,624,2
mturk_agent_1,"Would it work if I had two wood, two food, and one water?  I don't drink a lot.🙂🙂",624,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think I can make that work for me. Since this is important and we both have health worries make sure and think about it before we make an agreement. Your priorities were food then wood, right? I'd hate for us to make a hasty decision and regret it once were actually out there camping.",624,3
mturk_agent_1,I completely understand.  It's not fun being out there in the wilderness and coming up short.  Our health is also of the utmost importance.  Nobody will have fun if we get sick.,624,4
mturk_agent_2,"You needed wood and food most. I need water the most and the other two just to make sure I stay healthy. After double checking I think that that agreement works out perfectly. That would mean two waters, one food, and one wood for me then. 🙂",624,4
mturk_agent_1,Thank you so much for understanding my health challenges.  I will submit the deal.🙂,624,5
mturk_agent_2,No worries. I appreciate you working with me on my needs as well.,624,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,624,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,624,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I'd like to take all of the firewood and food. you can have water 🙂",625,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I’d like one of those firewood’s and 2 of the food. You are free to take water ,625,0
mturk_agent_2,I feel too cold and hungry. I'd like to take all of the firewood and 2 of the food. you can have 1 food and water. ,625,1

mturk_agent_1,Hey! Nice getting to interact with you and let's have a nice and enjoyable camping trip!,626,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi nice to meet you. We should have an enjoyable camping trip.,626,0
mturk_agent_1,I would need additional packages of water as I get dehydrated quickly. Let me know your requirements.,626,1
mturk_agent_2,I need additional Firewood because I am so cold at night. I also get dehydrated and get leg cramps in the middle of the night if I don't drink enough water.,626,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, get it as you are need of additional firewood, we can possibly have a fair deal of water and firewood then, 2-1 of former and 1-2 of latter.",626,2
mturk_agent_2,Are you saying I could get 2 additional firewood and 1 additional water?,626,2
mturk_agent_1,Yes,626,3
mturk_agent_2,What about the food? How should we share it? Can I have 2 and you have 1?,626,3
mturk_agent_1,"hmm, that needs a bit of thought",626,4
mturk_agent_2,I have my grandkids with and they are always hungry.,626,4
mturk_agent_1,"I have to give in for that, you can have 2 of it.",626,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,626,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,626,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there, how are you doing today?",627,0
mturk_agent_2,Great! How about YOu?,627,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm doing well! I'm excited about this camping trip, and hope we can figure out a great way to split the extra supplies.",627,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, my main concern is mosquitoes, so the longer the fire burns the better",627,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's totally true, mosquitoes are the worst. ☹️ I'm worried that all of the firewood around the camp is wet from recent rain though, I'd like to keep at least one package of it.",627,2
mturk_agent_2,"Also, I would like at least one additional water so i don't overheat in the weather.",627,2
mturk_agent_1,"Cool, that makes sense. I'm pregnant, so eating for two right now! It's exciting but makes me extra hungry. I'd like to prioritize getting food packages to keep us full and comfortable while camping.",627,3
mturk_agent_2,"No problem. How about you take all food items, one firewood, and I'll take all the water?",627,3
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds really close to even, but as it turns out, my husband only packed soda and beer in our cooler. If I could keep one water, then I'd have something to drink while camping. Does that sound okay?",627,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I will take that offer.",627,4
mturk_agent_1,"Fantastic, so it looks like we've decided you get 2 firewood, I get 1. I'll take all 3 food, and you get 2 water, I'll take one. Sounds good?",627,5
mturk_agent_2,"Agreed. Congrats on the baby, by the way!",627,5
mturk_agent_1,Thanks so much! Great working out our camping supplies together! Have a great summer! 🙂,627,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,627,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,627,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi!  So the forecast is showing much hotter temperatures than I expected, so I'll need some extra water.  I'm hoping you could give me at least 2? 🙂",628,0
mturk_agent_2,I was actually hoping to ask for all of the water in exchange for all of the firewood and all of the food.,628,0
mturk_agent_1,"So are you saying that I would get 3 firewood and 3 food, but no water?",628,1
mturk_agent_2,Th,628,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm sorry, what?",628,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry about that! I meant to say, that was my plan. I have a history of kidney stones and I need to drink more water than the average person, especially if I'm sweating a lot. ☹️",628,2
mturk_agent_1,"No problem!  I think that should be okay, but are you sure you don't need anything else?",628,3
mturk_agent_2,"I should be OK if I have at least 2 bottles of water. I'm a small guy with a thrifty metabolism, so I don't anticipate needing extra food.",628,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay!  Thanks for being so easy 🙂,628,4
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you too! So, are we agreed that I will take two bottles of water and give you one, and give you all 3 food packs and all 3 firewood stacks?",628,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,628,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,628,5
mturk_agent_2,hi,629,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi , I was wondering about splitting the resources.",629,0
mturk_agent_2,"good,I like to moment in the happy",629,1
mturk_agent_1,How about I get all the water and you take the firewood and we split the food?,629,1
mturk_agent_2,A good solution in the better thinking for the food and water to collect.,629,2
mturk_agent_1,what do you need most?,629,2
mturk_agent_2,water,629,3
mturk_agent_1,What else?,629,3
mturk_agent_2,food and firewood is very important.,629,4
mturk_agent_1,"If you are wasting my time , we can just leave now. ",629,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I want fill conforming to the submit.",629,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,629,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,629,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello. I am so looking forward to this camp out. My daughter just called and said she is going to come and bring some of her firiends. 🙂,63,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I was going out with a bunch of my buddies. We like to hike a lot in the sun, so we need lots of water. How does it sound if i take all the food and water, but you get all the firewood?",63,0
mturk_agent_2,I love hiking. My daughter is bringing extra water. So we could trade the water for the firewood. We do need just a little food as I didn't plan on having an extra person.,63,1
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, okay, that sounds reasonable. How does 3 water, 2 food and 1 firewood for me, and all the rest for you sound?",63,1
mturk_agent_2,Im goign to need all the firewood I can get. They want to cook smores on it. How about you get 3 water 2 food and I get 3 firewood and 1 food. I think that is very fair and would help us both out. 🙂🙂,63,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like a very reasonable deal, I understand how girls can get with their snacks haha. I'm okay with giving up all the firewood. You said you need at least some of the food, right?",63,2
mturk_agent_2,Thanks. Yea they do  love their snacks LOL. Yea I just need 1 extra food. Snice I wasn't planning on her friend coming. ,63,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, then the deal you mentioned earlier sounds good to me. You're okay with me getting 3 water 2 food and you getting 3 firewood and 1 food?",63,3
mturk_agent_2,🙂 Yep sounds like it will help us out the best snice you need water and food for your hike and I need firewood and just 1 food here at the camp.,63,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, then that sounds like a good deal for us both! It was a pleasure doing business with you, thanks!🙂",63,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,63,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,63,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi! How are you? I'm very pumped for this camping trip! 🙂,630,0
mturk_agent_1,"hey, I'm good too, i hope we have fun on this trip. how are you?",630,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm good, a little nervous. I'm planning to surprise my husband with a little Anniversary party while on this trip.",630,1
mturk_agent_1,"oh, that's so cute. I'm afraid we did not get enough food, or water for that matter.",630,1
mturk_agent_2,"I can spare water, but we are very short on food as well. I invited both sets of our parents to the party.",630,2
mturk_agent_1,"i hope we can figure something out, we have enough firewood.",630,2
mturk_agent_2,"If you want all of the water, I could take all of the wood, if that works for you. Then we can figure out the food situation. 🙂",630,3
mturk_agent_1,"yes, I think that will work, i would like to have 2 food if possible. ",630,3
mturk_agent_2,"I was also hoping for two of the foods. My husband's mom is very critical of me, and I can just imagine what she will say if we are short on food ☹️",630,4
mturk_agent_1,can you spare 1 firewood for 2 food?,630,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,630,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,630,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello how are you?,631,0
mturk_agent_2,I am doing fantastic. How are you doing today?,631,0
mturk_agent_1,I am worried because I need to get extra water for my trip so how about I get 2 Waters 1 food and 2 firewoods?,631,1
mturk_agent_2,"I can definitely sympathize with your plight. Why is it that you are in need of extra water, if I may ask? ",631,1
mturk_agent_1,I will need as much water as I can get because I will be hiking a lot.,631,2
mturk_agent_2,"I hear that. I'm in need of extra water myself, as I happen to suffer from Hyperosmolality, and I am also diabetic. So I was thinking maybe we cold split the packages up like 2 waters & 2 foods for me, and you can have all 3 firewoods and 1 food and 1 water",631,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like a good deal for you but I lost my arms in a hiking accident so I will need all the water and food firewood, you probably don't need it that much.",631,3
mturk_agent_2,"I don't think I would call that a good deal for myself. Hyperosmolality causes me to have excessive thirst and my doctors are concerned with the possibility of renal failure. And being diabetic puts me at extra risk, and it requires me to consume snacks throughout the day so I don't slip into a coma. I do not, however, have an arm that was amputated. How does that affect your water intake needs?",631,3
mturk_agent_1,"I understand that you could use the extra supplies but they kidnapped my wife and they will trade her for 3 water, 3 food and 3 firewood so I need tto hurry and save my wife.",631,4
mturk_agent_2,"😮Oh how awful for you! How would you carry all of that in addition to the supplies you ALREADY have with only 1 arm? I can make sure you have al of the firewood you need, as I would love to have a campfire but am also allergic to most trees (wood), as well as smoke",631,4
mturk_agent_1,How about I get 1 water and all the wood and 1 firewood,631,5
mturk_agent_2,I would be agreeable to that. I surely hope that your wife is safe and sound when you get to her.,631,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,631,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,631,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, wha is it that you need the most on your camping trip. I would like to get more firewood if possible",632,0
mturk_agent_2,I think that's okay with me since I live by the forest and can get some. You can have all the firewood if I can get all the food. Im bringing my teenage boys and they get SOOO hungry. Hope you can understand that!🙂,632,0
mturk_agent_1,i would like at least 1 food package i could give you 1 of the firewood so i would even it self out. We are bring more people than we planned an i would like to make sure everyone has enough food,632,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes I can understand that. I will take 2 food and you can have the other yes.,632,1
mturk_agent_1,okay thank you for understanding. I know hoe teenage boys can eat so i don't mean giving you more for your trip.,632,2
mturk_agent_2,What do you want to do about the water? I'm thinking I'll take 2 and I'll give you the other package of water,632,2
mturk_agent_1,just wondering why do you need more water?,632,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well with everything going on with COVID, the stores that I went to didn't have a lot of water left. So, with my three boys and I, we're running pretty low and the trip would go much smoother with more water.",632,3
mturk_agent_1,okay since we are going to be by water and will have plenty i can give you the 2 waters. so can you tell me our deal so i can make sure we all the same page and have a deal,632,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes. I have 2 food, 2 water, and 1 firewood. You have 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water. Thank you!",632,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,632,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,632,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you? I was wondering if I can get all 3 Firewood? I am taking over 20 members with me, lots of bonfires happening, plus its the summer, bugs will be ready to attack lol, If thats okay with you? what do you think?",633,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am good, thanks for asking🙂 I also need firewood, as we will be tent camping and have cool evenings in the desert.  My greatest need is water, however.  I could part with two firewood packages if you can give me all the water and 2 food packages.",633,0
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds like a fun trip! would you compromise? we are staying by a river, We can purify our water, would you be okay If I get all 3 Firewoods and you'll get all 3 waters? Will that be okay with you?",633,1
mturk_agent_2,"I could do that if you can give me all the food.  Without the extra firewood, we will have to use all we have now for warmth in the evening, and will not have enough to cook with.  Thus, we would need to bring more prepared food and food that does not need to be cooked.  ",633,1
mturk_agent_1,"I completely understand your concerns. I do believe its an unfair trade, i will only have 3 firewoods and 0 foods, and 0 waters. I have a large group, I need to have at least one food. What do you think, I do appreciate you working with me. ",633,2
mturk_agent_2,I see what you mean . . . I can settle for 2 foods packages instead of 3.🙂,633,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you! taking alot of kiddos with me, they are little rascals, they eat everything onsite. On my end I will be getting 3 firewoods, 1 food, and 0 waters. ",633,3
mturk_agent_2,You are welcome . . . It sounds like we are ready to finalize?,633,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, we are, I do believe we need to have 10 conversations before we can submit? ",633,4
mturk_agent_2,"That is correct.  Just to confirm, we have agreed that you will take three firewood and and 1 food--I will take three water and 2 food.🙂",633,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, submitting deal on my end! Hope we get to work in the future again, have a wonderful day. 🙂",633,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,633,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,633,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I am looking to get some extra supplies for my camping trip.  Would you consider giving me the xtra packs of food for my trip?",634,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I don't mind but I'm like a water buffalo when it comes to downing water.  I think we can arrange something. Nice to meet you by the way.",634,0
mturk_agent_1,Nice to meet you too.  I am happy to hear that you are willing to giv eme extra food for my trip.  I really dislike camping and I hope the extra food will give me some comfort on this miserable trip.,634,1
mturk_agent_2,"Speaking of miserable, my last camping trip was miserable because we decided to go camping in February.  It was 40 degrees out! 😮.  Can I get two of the firewood as well? ",634,1
mturk_agent_1,I hope it is not that cold this trip.  I would be happy to give you 2 wood and I will take 1.  ,634,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, so are you ok with me getting 3 waters, and 2 firewood.  You can take the rest.  you get 3 food and 1 firewood",634,2
mturk_agent_1,I would be ok with that.  I am just happy to havee extra food to keep me happy this trip.  ,634,3
mturk_agent_2,🙂I like food too but I love water.  I always bring a huge container with me everywhere I go.,634,3
mturk_agent_1,That is good for me.  I will take all the food and 1 firewood.,634,4
mturk_agent_2,"Awesome - camping is really fun.  You should give it an open mind when you all go.  I didn't enjoy initially, but it has grown on me other than the 40 degree trip.",634,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,634,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,634,5
mturk_agent_2,Can't wait to go on this trip.  Taking the whole family and my hyper active kids will probably need more water and food than what's provided. ,635,0
mturk_agent_1,"I see that you prefer the water and food.  We are heading out to Joshua Tree for some hiking.  We really need the extra water, and, there is no firewood to collect out there, so extra firewood would be very helpful for the cold, windy nights.🙂",635,0
mturk_agent_2,Water is my main concern.  Keeping the little ones hydrated is a full time job.  I'm kind of concerned with how cold it might get at night.  Some extra firewood might be helpful.,635,1
mturk_agent_1,"We have a good size group; we are expecting 12-15, and some of those are teenagers, so the water, food, and firewood will all be helpful for us too.  I would like to take the waters and firewood.  Perhaps there are places for you to pick up some extra water, perhaps natural water sources? Out in the desert, we have no natural water sources to filter water or anything like that.🙂",635,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm going to need 2 waters and at least 1 firewood.  Some food also.,635,2
mturk_agent_1,"😮 I see.  I actually need at least two of the waters also.  I can leave you two food, one firewood, and one water.  I have a larger group than you, and I think my need is greater given that we are in desert conditions. Given the need, I submit that this is a fair offer.",635,2
mturk_agent_2,"Group size isn't a concern since the basic supplies were enough for your trip.  If you want 2 waters, I'm going to have to get 2 firewoods and 2 foods along with a water.",635,3
mturk_agent_1,"☹️ Group size is an issue. The 'enough' is only an estimate.  A package of extra water will go much less further with 4 people than with 15.  Your offer will not work for me.  I ask you to reconsider my last offer.  I am ready to finalize, but if we cannot come to agree, then we will both suffer.  ",635,3
mturk_agent_2,It's a give and take.  We both want water the most. I gave in on that and agreed you could have 2.  Now you'll have to compromise a bit and let me have 2 firewoods and 2 foods.  It's only fair we both give in some. 🙂,635,4
mturk_agent_1,"You might consider that fairness is not just about distribution, but about need. You haven't really convinced me that your need is as great as mine so that you should get the the greater of extra supplies. My final offer is twofold: to take 2 water and 2 firewood and one food, or, two firewood and three water.  If neither of those will work for you, or unless you have a better offer, then I will have to walk away.",635,4
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,635,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi! I hope we can work together on an offer that is fair to both of us.🙂,636,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello.  Are you ready to go camping?,636,0
mturk_agent_2,"Of course I do, I love camping. Could you tell me which item is the one you need the most?",636,1
mturk_agent_1,food the most,636,1
mturk_agent_2,I need food the most too since I'm a little tired of carrying so much water. What do you need the least?,636,2
mturk_agent_1,probably firewood.  I can give you 1 food,636,2
mturk_agent_2,"I understand, what I least need is water since I brought enough. What do you think about this offer:You have 2 food, 1 wood and 1 water.",636,3
mturk_agent_1,I think that works out well.  It seems fair enough.,636,3
mturk_agent_2,"Perfect, I'm glad we can come to an agreement. Thank you.🙂",636,4
mturk_agent_1,Me too.  You can enter it into the right side.,636,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,636,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,636,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello there,637,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello 🙂,637,0
mturk_agent_2,So I am going camping and I am assuming you are as well.  What would be your main focus?,637,1
mturk_agent_1,My main need is water first and food second. What about you?,637,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well I plan on going on a long hike, so water is of the utmost importance.  2nd for me would be firewood to keep the bears away while I rest.",637,2
mturk_agent_1,Water is my first priority too. How about this. I'll give you 2 waters and you give me one. I'll give you two 2 firewood if you give me 3 food packages. How does that sound?,637,2
mturk_agent_2,"I was thinking I would sacrifice water, so you get all 3.  I would then get all firewood and 2 food.",637,3
mturk_agent_1,I am willing to accept that.,637,3
mturk_agent_2,"Alright then, we both get what needs to be done, done.🙂",637,4
mturk_agent_1,Yes absolutely. It was a pleasure negotiating with you. 🙂,637,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,637,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,637,5
mturk_agent_1,Will you give me 2 packages of water for 1 package of firewood?,638,0
mturk_agent_2,I can give two packages of food in exchange for your firewood.,638,0
mturk_agent_1,What about you take all the firewood and i take all the water?,638,1
mturk_agent_2,I can do that.,638,1
mturk_agent_1,That was cool. And will you give me 2 packages of food?,638,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like a fair deal. I can do that.,638,2
mturk_agent_1,Seems like we have a deal.,638,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay. Just so we're clear, I take 3 firewood and 1 food. You take 3 water and 2 food. Correct?",638,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yea, this is a fair deal.",638,4
mturk_agent_2,Very good. Let's submit the deal,638,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,638,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,638,5
mturk_agent_1,hello I need to bring 3 packages with me of firewood,639,0
mturk_agent_2,"Oh no! I need fire wood too! If I give you all of the firewood, can I have all of the water and 2 of the food?",639,0
mturk_agent_1,What do you need all the water for?,639,1
mturk_agent_2,I get really thirsty from singing around the camp fire 🙂,639,1
mturk_agent_1,I see,639,2
mturk_agent_2,So I assume it is okay if I take all of the water and 2 of the food?,639,2
mturk_agent_1,"You can take all of the water, but I really need all of the food because I am bringing my whole extended family.",639,3
mturk_agent_2,That leaves me without firewood or food though...How about you can have 2 of the food and I will have 1?,639,3
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds good, you can also have 1 firewood",639,4
mturk_agent_2,Okay! We have a deal! Nice meeting you! 🙂,639,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,639,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,639,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello there.  I am excited about this camping trip!,64,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm also excited, I love the outdoors!",64,0
mturk_agent_1,"My favorite thing to do is sing songs and tell stories around a campfire.  Consequently, I was really hoping to get some additional packages of firewood. 🙂",64,1
mturk_agent_2,I do love sing alongs around the campfire. I usually go hiking and it requires a lot of energy and fuel. Maybe I can get additional food packages?,64,1
mturk_agent_1,You'll definitely need some additional calories if you want to do extra hiking.  I will give you all the additional food if you give me all the additional firewood. ,64,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds like a deal, maybe split the water packages evenly. Can't be dehyradated while camping 🙂",64,2
mturk_agent_1,Agreed.  Your fun trip could turn into something quite dangerous without that hydration.  ,64,3
mturk_agent_2,"Of course, that won't be fun. ☹️ So we have agreed",64,3
mturk_agent_1,"Mostly - since we cannot split the water 1-1, do you mind if I take the extra one? 🙂 ",64,4
mturk_agent_2,"That's fine, you might need it more.",64,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,64,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,64,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi! I hope we can come to an arrangement that works well for both of us! Here is my proposal. I'm excited about this camping trip. How about you?🙂,640,0
mturk_agent_1,I can't wait to go camping! Being indoors for a few months has been tough! What is your proposal?,640,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm going to need a lot of firewood, because I'm doing all of my cooking on the fire and brought supplies especially to make s'mores, so I'm asking for 3 firewood bundles. Also, I need extra food, because I had to work overtime and didn't get to shop, so 2 of the food would be great. I'm pretty OK on water; you could have 2 of those.",640,1
mturk_agent_1,"I need as much water as I can get, so I will gladly give you all of the food if you will give me the water?",640,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'm willing to do that, if I can have all the firewood.",640,2
mturk_agent_1,Can I have at least one of the firewood? I am worried about getting cold! ,640,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, I can do that! We don't want you freezing out there! 🙂",640,3
mturk_agent_1,Great! I appreciate it! Smore's sounds like a great idea! Have an extra one for me!,640,3
mturk_agent_2,"I wish I could send you one, LOL!",640,4
mturk_agent_1,I haven't had smores in probably 30 years. I might need to go pick up some supplies to have at home!,640,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,640,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,640,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi🙂,641,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi!  I would like to propose that I receive 3 waters, 1 firewood, and 2 foods.  What do you think?",641,0
mturk_agent_1,Hmm...that's a pretty big ask. ,641,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, what are some of your priorities?  I would really prefer 3 water because I am afraid of germs and want the extra water for cleaning and washing.",641,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm thinking I really need food because I am pregnant, so I would like : 3 food and 2 fire wood ",641,2
mturk_agent_2,"Wow, you are brave to go camping when you are pregnant!!  What are your thoughts on water?  Would you take 1 firewood and 2 foods?",641,2
mturk_agent_1,"🙂 I know! Kind of scary but should be fun. I am willing to take 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood",641,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, that sounds pretty fair to me.  Thank you for the 2 water, it really puts my mind at ease 🙂",641,3
mturk_agent_1,I totally understand. Water is a necessary item for camping. I think I can get by with what I have plus the one extra !,641,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, and you will need the extra food for you and the baby, you will be using up a lot of energy hiking and camping.",641,4
mturk_agent_1,so it's safe to say we've agreed...,641,5
mturk_agent_2,yes I think so🙂,641,5

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,641,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello,642,0
mturk_agent_1,Hey there.  How are you today? )  Looks like we have some extra necessities to distribute for our camping trips.,642,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm good, I hope you're well too. Yes I see that as well. Is there anything you need as a priority?",642,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm good, thanks. Well, there's a few of us so food would be great for us.  We're going hiking and will probably go through what  we have fast.  Water is also good, for that reason.  What about you?",642,1
mturk_agent_2,My group is planning on doing quite a bit of hiking while we're camping and will need extra water and some extra food given the physical exertion we're planning. We don't need much firewood as we have brought some extra from home. If we can have 2 of the 3 waters we'd be happy to take only 1 of the food.,642,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me.  Do you want some of the firewood at all?,642,2
mturk_agent_2,"Perhaps we could use just 1 wood. That would be 2 water, 1 food and 1 wood for us and the rest for you? How would that do for your group?",642,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds like a plan.  That would be great.,642,3
mturk_agent_2,Do you camp often?,642,4
mturk_agent_1,"I was just about to ask you that!  Yeah, not as much as I use to, but it's fun when I can make it out.  How about you?  ",642,4
mturk_agent_2,Same for me. I went camping more often as a child and wish I could go more now.,642,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,642,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,642,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I am going on a camping trip this weekend with my family and I was wondering if you could spare 3 waters and 3 food items? ",643,0
mturk_agent_1,"I am okay giving up the food items, but I need water for my family to hike and camp with.  I would also like the 3 firewood since we will be using it for fires to cook our food.",643,0
mturk_agent_2,"I hear you, but I heard it is going to be really hot were we are going and I can't afford to give up any water. I have small kids and really need some extra water to use. Also, we like to have a fire at night so I can't give you all my wood. What do you like to do on your camping trips",643,1
mturk_agent_1,I also have small kids with me who go through water like crazy.  We love to venture out and go on hikes.  We also enjoy spending time by the campfire at night to cook our dinner and make smores.  That is where we really have the best family time.  I will need the firewood for that.  ,643,1
mturk_agent_2,Well I will give you 2 firewoods and 2 waters for 3 foods and 1 firewood. Sounds like we both have similar interests when we go camping.,643,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds perfect.  It sounds like you have a lot of little mouths to feed.  What do you do camping>,643,2
mturk_agent_2,We also like to hike and have a fire each night. How long are you camping for?,643,3
mturk_agent_1,"We will be camping for a long weekend, so 4 nights.  How about you?",643,3
mturk_agent_2,we are going for a week so the more food we can get the better.,643,4
mturk_agent_1,Sounds good.  Enjoy your trip!,643,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hi!🙂 I'm ok, thank you. Hope you are well. ",644,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am well,  getting ready for my trip but I need three extra firewood.  I can give you two waters and one more food for you to have.",644,1
mturk_agent_1,"I am content to give you three firewood, but I will need more food. Do you prefer campfires?",644,1
mturk_agent_2,"I need it in case I get cold because I just had the flu, also so I can see at night.  My night vision is not good.  Is there a reason you need more food?",644,2
mturk_agent_1,"😮 Oh, yes I can understand that. I have a medical condition that requires I maintain a stable blood sugar, so I would need the most food.",644,2
mturk_agent_2,I think I could give you an extra water but don't think I can part with the food.  ,644,3
mturk_agent_1,I can offer three firewood if you are willing to offer three food. I am content with one water. ,644,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, so will you agree to three food and one water?",644,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I can agree to that. You will take three firewood, two water, and no extra food.",644,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hey, I'm doing good, thank you 🙂 Yes, ",645,0
mturk_agent_1,What are you in need of more?,645,1
mturk_agent_2,"Water, as that's something I need/use a lot and want to store it in case of Emergency.",645,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can do that, how much water do you think you need?",645,2
mturk_agent_2,2 packages,645,2
mturk_agent_1,Two packages of water for 2 firewood?,645,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I'm fine with that. What is your requirement on food?",645,3
mturk_agent_1,"I can do just one, because I can always find more food, fishing or in the wild",645,4
mturk_agent_2,"That's a good idea. Though it was my second priority thinking I can manage with water, I'll do with the remaining.",645,4
mturk_agent_1,"Are we all done with out trade? your sure about everything? your fine with food,water, wood",645,5
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, Water and Food -2, Firewood -1",645,5

mturk_agent_1,Hi there! 🙂,646,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I'm very excited for this upcoming camping trip!! 🙂,646,0
mturk_agent_1,I am as well! I see we have some extra supplies. What are you most in need of?,646,1
mturk_agent_2,I really could use the extra water. I have two big dogs that are coming along on the trip. How about you?,646,1
mturk_agent_1,"Water would be nice, but I would feel bad taking water from dogs. I guess I could use firewood and food if you need the water.",646,2
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, thanks! How much food would you like? ",646,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I could use a combination of firewood and food to make up for missing water. Maybe all the firewood and two food and you get all water and one food?",646,3
mturk_agent_2,I would be fine with giving you all of the firewood if I get all of the water. I was really hoping to get two of the foods because I wanted to have a small birthday celebration for my husband. :) ,646,3
mturk_agent_1,"If you get all the water, you would be at an advantage with all the higher valued items. I would ask that I'm compensated for giving the higher value items by getting more items overall.",646,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I guess that's fair. 🙂",646,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,646,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,646,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, there. How are you doing? I would like your help with a camping trip.",647,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I'd like to help you with yours as well.,647,0
mturk_agent_2,Great! What items do you need the most?,647,1
mturk_agent_1,Extra firewood would be really helpful for me. I'm allergic to mosquitoes so I have to keep a fire going. What about you?,647,1
mturk_agent_2,Hmm....I also really need firewood because it's very cold where I am camping. I don't really need water through. Do you need that?,647,2
mturk_agent_1,I don't really need water either. But i'll trade 3 of my waters for 3 of yours 🙂,647,2
mturk_agent_2,I don't understand. Do you mean that you want to give me three waters?,647,3
mturk_agent_1,"No, I mean we can swap waters. I like your packaging better.",647,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay...I guess that's fine. Since you really need firewood, I am willing to give you two firewoods and I get one. But I will need to get 3 foods to pay for this deal.",647,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good. Would you still like to swap water?,647,4
mturk_agent_2,"I am not sure if that is how this works. I am only able to give 3, 2, or 1 waters to you. I cannot swap them. Is it okay if I give you one water?",647,5
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, I had the wrong idea. Yes, so two firewood and 1 water for 3 food?",647,5
mturk_agent_2,Yes. I will submit the deal.,647,6
mturk_agent_1,Great! Thanks alot,647,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,647,7

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, hope you are doing well 🙂 I would like to take 3 packages of food, 2 packages of firewood, and 2 packages of water.",648,0
mturk_agent_1,"No thank you i have a medical condition and a large family, i will take 3 packages of water 2 and 2 firewood",648,0
mturk_agent_2,I am sorry to hear about your medical condition ☹️ I could give you the waters but I have a young kid and just recently went through a divorce. This is our bonding time and she really wants to make s'mores. I need extra firewood and food to be able to do that.,648,1
mturk_agent_1,You only have one kid i have 6 i can spare all the firewood and 1 food🙂,648,1
mturk_agent_2,That is fair! Would it be possible for you to spare one water as well just in case of emergency we don't die due to lack of water? ,648,2
mturk_agent_1,You wont believe me. You already have the basics! just be safe!🙂 If i dont get a certain amount of water into my system each day i can die on a normal day,648,2
mturk_agent_2,I can concede to that. Would you like to finalize the deal where we stand then? I feel we have come to pretty fair negotiations for both of us! 🙂,648,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes i agree, We may need to talk a bit more",648,3
mturk_agent_2,"I agree too. So the final agreement so we are clear in communication is you get all the water, I get all the firewood and we split the food 2/1 for me?",648,4
mturk_agent_1,No 2 food me 1 you😮,648,4
mturk_agent_2,"To my understanding, in your original offer you stated you wanted 2 food and then offered to give me a food that would equal 2 for me and 1 for you. I will be willing to concede on this if you give me one water and I will give you one firewood. ",648,5

mturk_agent_1,THat is not what we agreed on,648,9
mturk_agent_2,I was negotiating under the belief that I was getting 2 foods as stated in your original offer. I apologize for the confusion but this is how it came across. What concessions could we agree upon with this now cleared up on my end. I would really like that one water ration.,648,10
mturk_agent_1,No i said 1 for you. I have 6 kids you have 1. You dont even need extra,648,10
mturk_agent_2,"Could you please clear up your original counter offer for me? ""No thank you i have a medical condition and a large family, i will take 3 packages of water 2 and 2 firewood"" I think there was possibly a word left out somewhere.",648,11
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,648,11
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,648,12
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there. I'd like 3 packages of food, and 2 packages of firewood. You can have 1 package of firewood and then all of the water.",649,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi there! Hm. I was actually thinking that the food and firewood would be more useful to me than the water.,649,0
mturk_agent_2,I see. Can you please explain why?,649,1
mturk_agent_1,"The group I'm camping with is having a fireside gathering in the evening, and I wanted to bring some food to share (doesn't food always taste best outside? 🙂) and also some firewood to contribute. Is there a particular reason you also wanted the food and firewood more?",649,1
mturk_agent_2,"That's understandable. I'm camping with a group of eight people for a whole week so I want to ensure that we have enough food for everyone. If we have enough firewood, we can cook enough meals to keep everyone fed 🙂",649,2
mturk_agent_1,"🙂  Great minds think alike!  Here's a thought: my group is also doing some hiking during the day, and of course, since it's summer, we want to make sure we have enough water. So I could definitely see splitting this in a ""some of each"" way for all three items.",649,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that sounds great to me. How about we each take two packages of food, firewood, and water to start. Then, you can either take an extra package of food and I will take the extra firewood and water?",649,3
mturk_agent_1,"You say ""each take two"" of each of the three items ... I think you must have meant ""each take one""? (There's a total of three of each item.) If so, for the extra, I think ""food + wood"" goes together better. How about one of us takes the extra water, and the other takes the extra food & wood?",649,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, my mistake. I mean you take 1 food package, 1 firewood package, and 1 water package, and then I will do the same. Then, you can take the food and wood and I will take the extra package of water! ",649,4
mturk_agent_1,That works beautifully! I hope you'll have a wonderful camping trip. 🙂,649,4

mturk_agent_1,Hello!  Great to see another camper here going for a hike.  My family is looking forward to a great weekend here.🙂,65,0
mturk_agent_2,Mine too! Camping is one of my favorite things to do with my family.,65,0
mturk_agent_1,It should be a good weekedn for it.  Unfortuately the air;ine loss our luggage with the sleeping bags and food.  Not a good start for us with my mother-in-law along for the first time.  My wife and her is down getting trail maps while I sort out keeping warm tonight and feed after some hiking.,65,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh no! That sounds like a problem. I have four kids so I can relate about the concerns for staying warm and having enough food.,65,1
mturk_agent_1,I see they have some supplies here to share between the camp sites.  Maybe we can divide up the supplies so it works for both of us.  I can really use 2 wood and 2 food.  What about yourself?🙂,65,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think food is pretty important for you, so I'm ok with you having 2 food and I'll take 1 food. Since you get more food I think it's only fair I get 2 firewood while you take 1. You can collect more firewood along the way. I didn't have room to pack firewood either with our smaller car.",65,2
mturk_agent_1,Sounds good on the food.  I was really hoping for doing roasting lots of marshmellows for s'mores eachnight along with staying warm.  If I keep 2 wood could you do with 2 water instaed?  ,65,3
mturk_agent_2,I have a kid obsessed with fire. He was really looking forward to a fire every night and marshmallows. I don't think I can do 1 firewood. Can you do 1 firewood and 2 water?,65,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, That would be ok with me.  That ends up with 2 food, 1 wood and 2 water for me and the rest for you?🙂",65,4
mturk_agent_2,Yep. 🙂 I hope you have a great trip!,65,4

mturk_agent_2,Good afternoon! Do you have a preference or priority on your supplies? I have some for mine.,650,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi! I actually do have a preference. For this trip my family and I plan to do a lot of hiking. For this reason, I would like additional water. ",650,0
mturk_agent_2,"It seems like we have the same priority for priority number one. I'm going on a back-country trip and always find I run out of water before I run out of food. I think we should split it as equitably as possible. My second and third priorities are food, then firewood last. Are yours the same?",650,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, my priorities are the same as yours. ",650,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, maybe we should meet in the middle. I'm more flexible on water and firewood than I would be on food. Do you feel you'll need extra firewood or food?",650,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would prefer the extra food, versus the additional firewood as I typically do not find myself needing any more than the basics. ",650,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm also going as a single person, so I feel I can do more without than you. I can probably find a better use for the extra firewood. ",650,3
mturk_agent_1,"What if I take 2 water, 1 food and 1 firewood? ",650,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think that would be fair, but I also think I could give you 1 water, 2 food, and 1 firewood. Or perhaps for you to get 2 water, 2 food, and 1 firewood. ",650,4
mturk_agent_1,I am ok with my offer of 2-1-1 but would be ok with your suggested offer of 2-2-1 as well. ,650,4

mturk_agent_2,I am. I can't wait. ,651,0
mturk_agent_1,Me too! I am hopeful that you have food and water to spare?,651,1
mturk_agent_2,I really need the food. I have a couple of teenagers who like to eat. ,651,1
mturk_agent_1,I understand that! Any chance you might be able to spare just one food and all three waters?,651,2
mturk_agent_2,I can spare one food. I need the waters though. How about 1 food and 1 water and 2 firewood for you? ,651,2
mturk_agent_1,Can I have all three firewood?,651,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think that will work 1 food, 1 water and 3 firewood? ",651,3

mturk_agent_2,"I'm doing well, thank you. I need you to make an important deal with me 🙂",652,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's great, and I'm happy to do that. I'm really wanting some extra food for this trip, because I'm a pretty big guy and I get intense snack cravings",652,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh no, that will not do at all. ☹️ We need all the food we could get, as two of our other camping members are type 2 diabetic and they may die! Could you give us food instead? We need it more than you!",652,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would prefer to have at least one food, and I would be okay giving up two if you can give up water. Would that work? 🙂",652,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that will be OK. 🙂 ",652,3
mturk_agent_1,Awesome. I would like 2 of the firewood if that's cool. My group wants to tell ghost stories at night around a campfire. 🙂,652,3
mturk_agent_2,"I don't think that's possible, as our group is going to have a massive bonfire party! 🙂 Would your group like to join us? Simply merge all of your resources with ours and we will have a blast! We also have some hot girls coming over to camp on the beach with us.",652,4
mturk_agent_1,"We don't really care about the hot girls, and we're looking to have a private outing. How about if you take 2 food and 2 firewood, and I take i food, 3 water. and 1 firewood?",652,4

mturk_agent_1,I'm set for firewood if you need the extra. 🙂,653,1
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks, I could use a bit of firewood but I'm actually more worried about water.",653,1
mturk_agent_1,"The thing I'm most worried about is food. I'm 8 months pregnant, so I have a lot of cravings. 🙂",653,2
mturk_agent_2,"First off, Congrats on the baby. That must be very exciting. And I think I can some food for a mother to be.",653,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you! If you are cool with it, you can have all of the water, and I'll take all the food.",653,3
mturk_agent_2,"Actually with a baby on the way, you might need some extra water to go with that food. Drinking and eating for 2 and all.",653,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, so what were you thinking?",653,4
mturk_agent_2,Why don't you take all 3 of the food and a water while I can use the 2 waters and the firewood.,653,4

mturk_agent_2,what is your priority?,654,1
mturk_agent_1,I would like to get extras of everything to be honest. I have always felt you cannot be too prepared. ,654,1
mturk_agent_2,Thats true! I would really like to get 3 food packages since i am going on a very long hike,654,2
mturk_agent_1,I would be okay with you getting 2 and me getting one package for food. ,654,2
mturk_agent_2,"ok, sounds good🙂",654,3
mturk_agent_1,"I would like to get 3 firewood packs. My left shoulder isn't the best, so chopping up falled branches would be difficult for me.",654,3
mturk_agent_2,"I really need the firewood too. I was hoping for 3 packs too. The Weather is supposed to be bad, really cold.",654,4
mturk_agent_1,Well there is only three packs total and we can't both get three. how about I get 2 and you get one? You can always bring an exra blanket. That would be much better for cold than a fire. I ened the fire to keep the anumas and bugs away,654,4
mturk_agent_2,"If i agree to that, then can i have 3 packs of water?",654,5
mturk_agent_1,"You would be getting all the water then. you are already getting two food. how about i get one water, one food and two wood. you get 1 wood two food and two water",654,5
mturk_agent_2,"well, i think that would be fair🙂",654,6

mturk_agent_2,I don't need much food so you can take the food.,655,1
mturk_agent_1,oh nice okay ,655,1
mturk_agent_2,Do you have any preferences of what you need?,655,2
mturk_agent_1,i would prefer food and firewood is last on my list ,655,2
mturk_agent_2,Great what if you take all the food and we figure out how to split the firewood,655,3
mturk_agent_1,yeah of course.  that works for me.  ill give you plenty of water ,655,3
mturk_agent_2,Great - how many firewood do you need?,655,4
mturk_agent_1,1 is fine.  id love 2 to three packages of food ,655,4
mturk_agent_2,"So what if I get all 3 waters, and 2 firewood - you take 1 of the firewood and all 3 of the food? Does that sound good to you?",655,5

mturk_agent_2,"Yes, and I will take 3 water and 2 firewood. Are you sure? ",658,2
mturk_agent_1,I think that is fare to me.  Any medical issues that make you need so much water?,658,3

mturk_agent_2,Ok if I can keep one water as well 🙂,66,3

mturk_agent_2,"I had too some kind of problems, I need food and water and firewood.",660,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes I also need firewood...How about I take 2 of the food and 2 of the firewood, and you take all the water?",660,2

mturk_agent_1,"Yes you can have 1 of the food and 1 of the firewood, and I'll take 2?",660,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok thank you very much then what we need.,660,3

mturk_agent_2,"Hi! 🙂 Thanks. That's really nice of you. However, I will be staying up late playing music with my companion. We will need our firewood. How often do you go camping?",661,0
mturk_agent_1,"Ah that sounds like a nice way to spend the evening. I definitely need some firewood, because I have kids, and they really want to make smores. It's a part of the experience.",661,1
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds fun. Sadly I am unable to give you much of my firewood as it is the primary reason for our trip. ☹️. However, i could offer some extra food for the kids. Is there anything else you need aside from wood?",661,1
mturk_agent_1,"We will definitely need water, as the kids will be running around. I'd be willing to give you a bundle of firewood, in exchange for water.",661,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok cool. I think I can give you some extra water. Do you need any extra food for the kids?,661,2
mturk_agent_1,"They are rather hungry, especially after running around outside, I would take some food and water in exchange for a bundle of wood.",661,3
mturk_agent_2,That's reasonable. However if I'm going to give both food and water I will need 3 bundles of wood in order to justify sacrifcing our limited water and food,661,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ah unfortunately, we do need some firewood for our campfire. I wouldn",661,4
mturk_agent_2,"☹️ Oh no! this is terrible. I'm so sorry. I was hoping we would be able to find a middle ground where we both could be happy. I could offer 1 bundle of food, 1 package of water and TWO packages of food. Does that sound appealing at all?",661,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, I am unsure that I understood your last message, as food is listed twice. I think I would need another bundle of water in order to give up two bundles of wood.",661,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,661,5
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,661,6

mturk_agent_1,"Good. Excited. I was wondering what your looking for, since we have limited supply and there is two of us",662,1
mturk_agent_2,I was hoping to get some additional firewood along with some water. I heard it's supposed to get really cold tonight so I would like to be well-prepared.,662,1
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good but it seems like we have the same idea.... Tell you what if you give me 2 firewood ill give you 2 waters and 2 foods. Or do you have a another plan ,662,2
mturk_agent_2,I think that sounds like an agreeable plan 🙂 I think we can work that out then,662,2
mturk_agent_1,"Only, if that is the case maybe I can trade my last food for that last fire wood. Its just a question. If not, its okay",662,3
mturk_agent_2,I don't think I can agree with that one. I will need some firewood tonight. I can work with giving two firewood to you and one for me. Along with the 2 waters and food,662,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, sounds like a plan. Ill submitt the deal",662,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I do not think that is a fair deal, I think that I should get 2 of the water, 2 of the firewood and 1 of the food items.",663,0
mturk_agent_2,What about I take all of the firewood because it is hard for me to get any and you take 1 water and 1 food.🙂,663,1
mturk_agent_1,"It is also hard for me to get firewood, so I think that I should get 2 firewood so that I can boil more water for myself, I will take only 1 water and 2 food.",663,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I will take 3 waters and 3 firewood and you can have all the food. I can get my own food. ",663,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think that since you can get your own food you could probably get your own water and firewood too, so I should get 2 food 2 firewood and 2 water since I have less abilities to survive outdoors on my own. 🙂",663,2
mturk_agent_2,"Pal,I am not is the health to get my own firewood. I am willing to give you all the food and two waters.🙂",663,3
mturk_agent_1,"I agree on me getting 2 waters, I think that I should get two food since you can get your own, and I should get at least one firewood since it will be hard for me to get my own firewood too.🙂",663,3
mturk_agent_2,"🙂 Ok, in all fairness I let you get 3 foods, 1 water, and no firewood. I think that this deal will work.",663,4

mturk_agent_2,How many times have you gone camping?,664,1
mturk_agent_1,"A few, how about you? What are your plans?",664,2
mturk_agent_2,"Depending on how long you're planning on camping,  you may not need to leave the campground. However, if you're planning a week-long vacation, you are most likley going to venture out. What does your family enjoy most? Look for a location that will meet those needs.",664,2
mturk_agent_1,We'll set down at one spot but go hiking a lot. I think we'll need some more extra food and water to make that happen. Would you be willing to give me 3 food and 2 water? You can have the other water and all of the firewood. ,664,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry dude, I have minimum 1 food package. Because, food is most important one of the human body.",664,3
mturk_agent_1,"OK, so how about I'll do 2 Food, 2 water and You can do 1 food, 1 water, and 3 firewood",664,4
mturk_agent_2,"If you don't mind i'll do 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood. Because, I have poly urea problem so water is must be need for me.",664,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry I really need more food than that. I'll do 2 food, 1 water, and 2 firewood if water is important for you.",664,5

mturk_agent_2,Hi! Are you excited to go on this trip!,665,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi! I am, but I really need firewood for my health. I get really cold and can slip into hypothermia. Would you mind if I took 2?",665,0
mturk_agent_2,You can have 2 firewoods if I can have 2 of the food packages. I am a vegan so it is hard to find options in the woods!,665,1
mturk_agent_1,"That is fine with me because I am on a diet, so it works out. I also have a baby who needs formula and I need water to make her bottles",665,1
mturk_agent_2,okay how many waters do you need?,665,2
mturk_agent_1,was hoping for 2... what do you think?,665,2
mturk_agent_2,okay that works for me!,665,3

mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I think I have a deal to split up the supplies, if I take 3 of the water and 2 of the firewood, would you accept all of the food and the rest of the firewood?",666,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi there! 🙂 That actually sounds like a pretty great deal.,666,0
mturk_agent_1,"Okay sure! I am mostly interested in the water, I had to give some of my water away earlier to a family that needed some, and now i'm afraid of running out! 😮 Is there any item that you prefer?",666,1
mturk_agent_2,"Food is my main priority. I am set on water, so I don't mind if you take all three. One firewood would be okay, but if I could take two, it would be ideal.",666,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I think we have that part settled. I can take all the water and you can take the food. We just need to figure out how to split the wood! My family didn't bring as much as we thought we needed from home, so a couple more would be useful for us.",666,2
mturk_agent_2,I am in the same boat. I don't have as much as I need to stay as long as I had planned. ,666,2
mturk_agent_1,Why do you need more food anyway? Did something happen?,666,3
mturk_agent_2,"I shared some food with some folks I met on the trail. I thought I had enough to last, but I'm getting low. I haven't hiked this much in a while and I am hungrier than I though I'd be! I'm afraid of running too low since I am camping on my own. You said you are camping with your family? ",666,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, we lost some of our food because I think some animals got into it. I guess we didn't store it right, too easy for them to get into it. But we brought a lot, so I think we are good on food.",666,4
mturk_agent_2,Well it works out that you are good on food and I am good on water! We just need to figure out the firewood.,666,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, we thought we might be able to collect firewood out here so we didn't bring as much. But park rangers told us that we're not supposed to do that ☹️",666,5

mturk_agent_1,"So, let's get to discuss on our camping trip. I prefer having additional packages of food. your thoughts?",667,1
mturk_agent_2,I would also prefer the additional packages of food. I have diabetes and if my blood sugar drops to low it will cause me to have a wide variety of health issues we would need to deal with. ,667,1
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, in that case I can substitute with water. So, can I have 1 and 2 packages of food and water each.",667,2

mturk_agent_1,Do you have any priority what you would like the most?,671,1
mturk_agent_2,Well I was hoping to get mostly some extra food for the trip. What are you looking to get?,671,1
mturk_agent_1,We are really hungry because we don't have food for a while so food is the most priority for us as well.,671,2
mturk_agent_2,"okay, well what else were you hopping to get? I'm interested in some extra firewood as well, I've got plenty of water though",671,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, we could share you two of firewood and one of food. Is it alright?",671,3
mturk_agent_2,"That could work, If I take 2 Food and 2 Firewood, you can have all the water.",671,3
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, we will share you two food and two firewood, we will have one food, one firewood and three water. ",671,4
mturk_agent_2,Sounds like a deal,671,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,671,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,671,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I'm elderly and I feel I need to have all 3 packages of the firewood, I can't sleep at night if I'm too cold 🙂",672,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello there. I understand you need that much firewood, but why not wear warm clothing if it is that extreme?",672,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well, the clothes that I brought with me are not that thick and I feel I'm really going to need the firewood to stay safe and warm.",672,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I understand. I am wondering if I can have all of the food packages due t othe fact that I am pregnant, so extra food will be helpful. I am eating for 2.",672,1
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, but I'm diabetic, so I'll have to ask for at least one of those food packages in case I get hypoglycemic.  Congrats, by the way!",672,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you. But if I can't have all of the food, then I am going to ask for 1 of the firewood. Since I will be needing fire to cook things I find in case I run out of food ",672,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, so 2 firewoods for me, one for you and two food packages for you and one for me.  Does that sound ok?  What about the water?",672,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes that sounds good. Are there any reasons why you may need all of the water?,672,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I do have to take many medications and my vitamin pills are HUGE, maybe one water for me? Two for you?",672,4
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds good also. You're diabetic and elderly, I would feel slightly guilty if you ran out of water, though. ",672,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,672,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,672,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello friend....,673,0
mturk_agent_2,hey there 🙂,673,0
mturk_agent_1,I am going to camping. I want some additional items.,673,1
mturk_agent_2,"okay. I also want some items.  in particular, I need firewood because I have poor blood circulation and could get frostbite otherwise",673,1
mturk_agent_1,No friend. I also need the same. Because of my eye problem. I need some more firewood.,673,2
mturk_agent_2,that stinks ☹️  it sounds like we both have serious issues.  you can have 2 firewood if I can get 2 water,673,2
mturk_agent_1,I will give you some extra water package. But please give me the firewood.,673,3
mturk_agent_2,how much are we talkin' here?,673,3
mturk_agent_1,Can you help me to share your firewood?,673,4
mturk_agent_2,"how about 1 wood, 2 water, 2 food for me?",673,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,673,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,673,5
mturk_agent_2,that's an unfair deal,673,6
mturk_agent_1,ok then you send me the deal,673,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,673,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,673,7
mturk_agent_2,Hello!,674,0
mturk_agent_1,Hey! Are you going camping anytime soon?,674,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I plan to go within the next few weeks.",674,1
mturk_agent_1,"So am I.  I know a guy that has some supplies we may need.  He has 3 bundles of firewood, 3 packs of water, and 3 boxes of food.  How do you think we should split them up?",674,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I have my basic supplies, but would like some firewood to cook some food and make some s'mores. 🙂 I also just discovered a new hiking trial nearby my campsite, so I would like some more water. Food is my lowest priority, but it is always good to have a few more snacks.",674,2
mturk_agent_1,"We are camping by a creek, so we have plenty of water.  Our plan is to have a big banquet on the last day, we we will need a bit of firewood and a lot of food.",674,2
mturk_agent_2,"Okay. I think you need the food the most, then.",674,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, and you'll probably need more water for those long hikes.",674,3
mturk_agent_2,"Definitely, I tend to drink a lot of water.",674,4
mturk_agent_1,"Now for the firewood.  I think I would need two bundles.  We are planning a big cookout, and will need to sanitize our water from the creek.  I think 2 bundles for me, and one for you would be acceptable.",674,4
mturk_agent_2,I think that is good on the firewood.,674,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,674,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,674,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! How are you today? Food is usually a pretty valuable resource, but I'm willing to let you have all of the food if I can have the wood and water.",675,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there, I'm doing ok.  I accidentally spilled my water on my firewood. ☹️  I'm in a world of hurt right now. ",675,0
mturk_agent_1,"Whoops! That's never good. At least the wood can dry out a bit! With as hot as it is lately, it should be dry in no time.",675,1
mturk_agent_2,"Good point, but its really humid where I am.  How about we split each category.. You can have 2 of the food, 1 water and 1 firewood, leaving me with 2 firewood, 2 water and just 1 food.",675,1
mturk_agent_1,"I have plenty of food, plus we brought our hunting equipment. I do agree that we should find a good way to split it, but since the site I'm camping at does not have a clean water source, I really need the water. How about I take two water and two firewood, then you can have all the food, one water, and one firewood?",675,2
mturk_agent_2,That really won't help me as I have plenty of food and no water or dry firewood.  How about I take 3 of the hardwood and just 1 water and you can have all of the food and 2 of water?,675,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think we can reach an agreement on this :-) We both need water and firewood, and we both have plenty of food. I do not want you to go without, but I really don't want to cut myself short on supplies either. I think I can make do with just two waters. I'm hesitant about the firewood, though. Is there anywhere nearby that you might can collect some wood so I can possibly have one?",675,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'm not sure, but I will agree to giving you 1 firewood, 2 waters and 2 of the food.  This way, we are splitting all of it, leaving me with 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food.",675,3
mturk_agent_1,I think I can live with that deal. I accept your offer! ,675,4
mturk_agent_2,Thank you for the wonderful chat and I hope you have a fun time camping!,675,4
mturk_agent_1,I hope you have a great time on your trip as well! ,675,5

mturk_agent_1,"i think i would need more water myself, sorry",676,1

mturk_agent_1,"I can do that, thank you so much",676,2

mturk_agent_2,"Hi, how are you?",677,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey I'm going great, how are you?",677,0
mturk_agent_2,Pretty good.  I'm camping in an RV.  We don't have any hunting tools so food and water is the most important to us.  How about you? ,677,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm on a camping trip with my five children, ages 4 months, 1, 3, 4, and 14.  They eat so much, I really need extra food for them and some water to make bottles for my four month old baby.",677,1
mturk_agent_2,"Then how about you get 1 food, 2 waters, and 1 firewoods",677,2
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking 1 food, 3 waters and I don't care about the firewood",677,2
mturk_agent_2,"OK, that works for me. ",677,3
mturk_agent_1,ok! then let's do it.,677,3
mturk_agent_2,🙂 Pleasure doing business with you,677,4
mturk_agent_1,"🙂 same to you, hope you have a nice rest of your trip",677,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,677,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,677,5
mturk_agent_2,How about I take 2 water and food and you can have two firewood. I really like water and thats about only think I drink . I don't drink sodas or coffee.🙂,678,0
mturk_agent_1,I pretty much only drink water too.  But I need water to make tea.  I have a hard time sleeping so I need to brew tea so that I can start to fall asleep.,678,0
mturk_agent_2,"I understand 🙂 its hard to fall asleep without nice cup of tea to relax you.  However, I only drink water and am intolerant to caffeine . I need to have water. ",678,1
mturk_agent_1,"You should already have drinking water for the trip, is there a reason you need that much additional water?",678,1
mturk_agent_2,I love to cook on the fire and that requires a lot of water. What is your preference on food and the firewood,678,2
mturk_agent_1,I will need to make small fires throughout the day to brew my tea.  Because I brew another tea during the day for energy to counteract the sleepy tea.,678,2
mturk_agent_2,I understand so it seems you would prefer water and firewood over food. Is that correct?🙂,678,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes but I do need some food because If I drink the tea on an empty stomach then it gets upset.,678,3
mturk_agent_2,I understand and would like to make a compromise than because I believe in sharing and equality.  🙂 How about I get one water two food and two firewood and you get 2 water 1 food and 1 firewood,678,4
mturk_agent_1,"That is almost what I was going to suggest.  I can agree to that, sounds good.",678,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,678,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,678,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello!  I am excited about my upcoming camping trip.  Let's chat about what resources we both need. 🙂,679,0
mturk_agent_2,"Me too! So being honest, i have a metabolism issue, which makes me burn through calories significantly faster than normal. so i would like more food if possible",679,0
mturk_agent_1,"Perhaps we can come to a deal, because my highest priority is firewood.  I want to have a roaring fire to cook over and also use it to dry out my simming clothes.  Plus, I have a child who is deathly afraid of the dark, so an ongoing fire is really important to me.",679,1
mturk_agent_2,thats more than fine,679,1
mturk_agent_1,"I would be willing to give all 3 extra food packages to you, if you will give me the 3 firewood.",679,2
mturk_agent_2,Sure! that would be great! i need the extra food. How about splitting the water?,679,2
mturk_agent_1,"As for the water, I would love to get 2 packages if you don't need the extra, because the weather is expected to be very hot where I'm going, and I am prone to dehydration :( ☹️☹️",679,3
mturk_agent_2,"I guess that is fine, There is a nearby stream where I am going. The water is very clean and I can drink from there.",679,3
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, I really appreciate that!  So you are ok with 3 food and 1 water?",679,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I will take that deal. It sounds fair to me.",679,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,679,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,679,5
mturk_agent_1,Hey!  I hope you're having a good week and staying well.  So we are negotiating on supplies! 🙂,68,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes. Hoping we can make a good deal.,68,0
mturk_agent_1,"Me too!  I'm hoping for two food items and one water.  I'm diabetic so if my blood sugar drops, I may need the extra carbs.  And water because water is important! 🙂 ",68,1
mturk_agent_2,I prefer two water and one food. I can understand why you need the extra food items. I'm not much of a snacker but do drink a lot of water all the time. Keeps me from eating more!🙂,68,1
mturk_agent_1,"Lol, it seems it was easy for us to come to a deal!  I'm super bad at drinking water (trying to get better) so I don't feel I'll need as much.  Do you want all of the firewood or should I take one and you take two?  ",68,2
mturk_agent_2,I don't have a preference on the firewood. You may have two if you like. It's so hot that I don't cherish the idea of a fire BUT it does keep the bugs at bay!🙂,68,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ooh, I didn't think of that!  I'm not a huge fan of fire but I'm even less a fan of bugs.  I'm good with two in that case.  I think we still have to meet the 10 message minimum before we can submit a deal.  So how's your day going?",68,3
mturk_agent_2,"So far, so good but it is too hot outside to enjoy. I have been watering the garden and trying to convince my dog to come out and play but she is not interested.",68,3
mturk_agent_1,"Lol, it's hot here too!  We are always in the 110-118 degrees out in the desert.  What kind of dog do you have?",68,4
mturk_agent_2,She is a Corgi with a fluffy coat so she is not a big fan of the heat. I guess you get a dry heat near the desert. We have a lot of humidity which is oppressive. Hoping it will be cooler on our camping trip!,68,4
mturk_agent_1,"Oh yeah, it's really dry here.  I sort of prefer that.  I haven't been in humidity much but it's so gross feeling.  Corgis are adorable!  Okay, I think we're ready to make a deal.  It was so nice chatting with you!",68,5
mturk_agent_2,"Same here! Thanks for your cooperation. It was so nice to chat with you. Stay safe, well AND cool!",68,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,68,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,68,6
mturk_agent_2,I need the additional food and water for the camping as I would find it useful during the camping activities. ,680,0
mturk_agent_1,Hey there.  Well I would really love the extra food as I don't think I brought enough from home.  ,680,0
mturk_agent_2,I will offer you 2 extra package of water alongside the firewood in order to allow me take 2 extra package of food ,680,1
mturk_agent_1,"So I would get 2 water, 1 food, and 3 firewood?",680,1
mturk_agent_2,"Nope. That won't be beneficial to both of us. You will get 1 food, 2 water and 1 firewood. Remember how important water is to our brain. ",680,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok well I really could use extra firewood too - I have no idea how to start fires well and am afraid of the dark.  If you need more food, would you be willing to take all 3 if I can have 2 firewood?",680,2
mturk_agent_2,Sure. It would be a nice deal,680,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, so the final deal I have is 2 water, 2 firewood for me and 3 food, 1 water, 1 firewood for you.  I am good with this if you are.",680,3
mturk_agent_2,Yeah. I'm would be nice. You get 2 firewood and 2 water while I get the rest. 🙂,680,4
mturk_agent_1,Ok deal! Thanks so much! 🙂,680,4

mturk_agent_1,So I was wonder what you need distributed well see if we can work somethign out,681,1
mturk_agent_2,Well due to a medical condition i need to eat more just for my body to be normal. It also leaves my body temperature colder which could lead me going into shock. I do need All the food and firewood,681,2
mturk_agent_1,Thats allot and wouldn't be good for me and my daughter I am willing to spare you the firewood and but will be needing 2 food and all of the water. I will give you all of the firewood.,681,2
mturk_agent_2,I need to eat more due to my condition 3 wood 2 food me 1 food 3 water you,681,3
mturk_agent_1,I understand that I hope you will be able to make he trip. 3 extra wood for one person you must have a serious condtion. It is a bit high given there are are more of us; I would be willing to distribute 3 food if I get all of the others ,681,3
mturk_agent_2,"Here how but this, 2 food me 2 firewood and 1 water",681,4
mturk_agent_1,I still dont see how that can be justfied given you are one person? maybe you shouldn't take the trip. As a distributor I like to hear all sides and reasons but I am concerned that its so one sided  ,681,4
mturk_agent_2,Oh you think its just me? I have a family of 6,681,5
mturk_agent_1,you have stated it was just you using verbs like me and I.,681,5
mturk_agent_2,You know what if you want to get caught up in pendantics we can just have no one get anything,681,6
mturk_agent_1,That wouldn't help any of us since you need the extra help. ,681,6
mturk_agent_2,"True but not liking your attitude, so either we walk from this or we can do it this way 2 foods 2 firewoods 1 water",681,7
mturk_agent_1,Hmm you seem very absolute and I apologize if you perceive any attitude and I am for New York we are know for our sassiness. It does seem to be about what you need and not hearing the other side I will have to give you a firm no unless you are willing to rework some of you're numbers.

mturk_agent_1,"I am going camping aswell, is there anything specifically that you really need?",682,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I am going with my kids and I am not really good at fishing and don't like to hunt. So I am looking to get some extra food for the trip",682,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thats a bummer since food is really important for me aswell, i have low blood sugar. How about water and firewood, how important are those for you?",682,2
mturk_agent_2,"I don't need too much firewood, but some extra water could help",682,3
mturk_agent_1,"Since we both need food the most, how about the one that gets two foods gets one water and one firewood, and the one that gets one food gets two waters and firewoods?",682,3

mturk_agent_1,I can let you have all the water. How about either 3 firewood and 1 food for me or 2 firewood and 2 food for me?,686,3
mturk_agent_2,2 firewoods and 2 foods is okay,686,3
mturk_agent_1,"ok, I'll send that as the deal",686,4
mturk_agent_2,okay so I will take 1 firewood 1 food and three waters,686,4

mturk_agent_1,"Good, going out camping soon.",687,1
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds nice, can you tell me about your preference",687,2
mturk_agent_1,"I really could use a lot of firewood, there is not a lot of plants at the campsite.",687,2
mturk_agent_2,"That is okay with me, What about the water?",687,3
mturk_agent_1,I don't really need water that badly. Lots of freshwater around I can drink.,687,3
mturk_agent_2,What about the food,687,4
mturk_agent_1,"I could use some extra food, but I'm mostly concerned with getting wood to cook some of my food.",687,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,687,5

mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, I don;t know what your offer is.",687,6

mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I'm well thanks for asking. I'm just trying to get this camping situation sorted out. How are you?",688,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm good.  Yeah, me too.  I have a big group heading out and we could use some extra supplies.",688,1
mturk_agent_1,Same here. It looks like a nice place with great facilities. I'm just worried about having enough food because I am diabetic and have low blood sugar. ,688,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm sorry to hear that ☹️.  Well I'm sure we could work out some kind of deal that leaves us both happy.,688,2
mturk_agent_1,"I was hoping you'd be open to some ideas. I have great camping equipment so I'm not too concerned with building bonfires. The only thing I can't really prepare for is my blood sugar intake as it varies especially at high elevations. I'm interested in having food on hand, but would love to lend you some firewood.",688,2
mturk_agent_2,"OK, how about I take 2 water, 2 firewood, and 1, and you take 1 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food?  ",688,3
mturk_agent_1,"I really appreciate your kindness on understanding my problem. But because of my diabetes I get thirsty a lot. What about I get 2 food, 2 water, and 1 firewood? Would that work for you? You seem confident and don't really have any stressors regarding your trip.",688,3
mturk_agent_2,"We have a pretty big group and it's looks like its going to be hot during the day and pretty chilly at night so I could definitely use the extra firewood.  Maybe I could take one water, 3 firewood, and 1 food?",688,4
mturk_agent_1,Oh the weather looks really hot during the day. I'm excited to fish and we have all the gear for the cold night. The chilly night wont be a problem for us so I am happy to share all the firewood you need. ,688,4

mturk_agent_1,"I'm good thanks. Yup, just getting ready. I was thinking since I have a larger group of people, additional food would be great. We also love campfires so extra firewood would also let us have more fun!",689,1
mturk_agent_2, I too have a diabetic problem so can you offer me some additional food and for that I'll offer you some firewoods,689,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I could take all the firewood and you could have all the food if you want. We could split the water.",689,2
mturk_agent_2,yes sure I am happy with this deal ,689,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, it will likely be hot where i'm going, would you mind if I had two waters?",689,3

mturk_agent_1,"Yes, absolutely. It is always fun camping with the kids. ",690,1
mturk_agent_2,Totally. So what I need most urgently is water. Our water purifier stopped working unfortunately ☹️.,690,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh am sorry about that but unfortunately the kids spilled some of our supply and we do need some water to survive our trip it seems ☹️ ,690,2
mturk_agent_2,Okay. How about I take 2 water and you take 1?,690,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, let me think it over. Meanwhile, how are you doing on firewood and food?",690,3
mturk_agent_2,"Food I am good on, but firewood has been rough as the axe our cabin provided broke. Thankfully no one was hurt though!",690,3
mturk_agent_1,"Oh am glad everyone is okay. we had to extend our trip and since the weather has suddenly changed, we will need some firewood too. So let me know what you think",690,4
mturk_agent_2,"How about this. I take 2 water, you take 2 firewood and 2 of the food? That should be enough for us I think",690,4
mturk_agent_1,Yeah but that would not work for us. We do need the water and firewood too. ,690,5
mturk_agent_2,What do you suggest?,690,5
mturk_agent_1,"I would like to fair and want both of us to enjoy our trip. I suggest we take 2 water, 1 firewood and 1 food and you take 1 water, 2 firewood and 2 food. What do you think?",690,6

mturk_agent_1,"No I'm not okay with this, I need 3 water  2 firewood and 1 food, I sure need them during the camp, what about 0 water 1 firewood and 2 food?",691,1
mturk_agent_2,I really need water for my family so I can't give all three. I am offering you 5 items while you are offering 3 so I don't think that is a very good deal ,691,1
mturk_agent_1,"Even I'm bring my family for the camp, so I need all three, you can take two food for your family and 1 firewood, i think you can accept this deal?",691,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can not accept that deal. I will do 1 water, 1 food and all three firewood. I could also do 1 water 2 food and 1 firewood ",691,2

mturk_agent_2,"If we do that, could I have 3 water?",692,1
mturk_agent_1,yes you can have all the water we have a large lake near us here.we have all the water we need.we would not be needing the water,692,2
mturk_agent_2,Excellent. So it looks like I would take 1 food and 3 water. Should we split the firewood so we each have enough?,692,2
mturk_agent_1,yes that is correct can i take 2 firewood while you take 1?I have a lot of people to keep warm,692,3
mturk_agent_2,"ok, that works for me.",692,3

mturk_agent_1,Hi- I am doing great. I am really excited about my upcoming camping trip and appreciate your willingness to split some packages!,693,0
mturk_agent_2,Me too! I checked the weather and it is going to cold. I'm looking for some more firewood and food. What are you looking for?,693,1
mturk_agent_1,"I plan on doing a lot of hiking and outdoor activities so my priority is the water and food.  Would you be interested if I took 3 packages of water, 2 food and 1 firewood?",693,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, considering there at 9 items, I'd like to make a trade that is 5 and 4. How about we trade Me: 3 fire wood, 2 food  and 0 water and you: 0 firewood, 1 food and 3 water? ",693,2
mturk_agent_1,Sounds like a reasonable offer.  What activities are you planning during your camping trip and how will each of your items be used?,693,2
mturk_agent_2,"My family is coming with me and we like to stay up late and talk, so I need enough firewood to last us long into the night. We are also making some special foods for a celebration. What will you be doing? ",693,3
mturk_agent_1,"We plan on doing a lot of hiking/visiting local landmarks. I definitely need water to stay hydrated while we are out and about, but we could definitely get food in town or if needed.  We plan on going to bed early and waking up early and not spending a lot of time around the campfire in the evening. Based on our plans, I will accept your offer of 3 water and 1 food. ",693,3
mturk_agent_2,sounds like a great idea. I'm glad we could come to an agreement,693,4

mturk_agent_2,I have kids with me that's the reason I need extra water and its summer,694,1
mturk_agent_1,I can give you all three waters if I can have 2 foods & all 3 firewood.,694,1
mturk_agent_2,It will be really hard to survive if I give you all 3 waters since all the packages are essential. 🙂,694,2
mturk_agent_1,Do you have another deal you'd be willing to make?,694,2
mturk_agent_2,It would be really hard for me  . please consider my deal ,694,3
mturk_agent_1,"Would you take 2 waters, 1 food and 2 firewood?",694,3
mturk_agent_2,"My preference is 2 waters, 2 food and 1 fire wood",694,4
mturk_agent_1,I'm sorry but I just won't be able to do that. ,694,4
mturk_agent_2,as you know it won't be beneficial if we break the deal,694,5
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, as well as you do I'm sure.",694,5
mturk_agent_2,I will take  2 food 1 water and 2 firewood,694,6

mturk_agent_2,That is fair! How many of the food and water do you need?,695,1
mturk_agent_1,You can have all the water if I can get all the firewood and two foods. Is that ok?,695,2
mturk_agent_2,That works for me! Where are you going camping?,695,2
mturk_agent_1,I'm going to Yosemite it is a beautiful place. What about you?,695,3
mturk_agent_2,I have never been there! Sounds amazing. We are staying local because of corona virus. It is sure to be here so that is why I need the water so much!,695,3
mturk_agent_1,That is very smart. I hope you have a great trip and stay hydrated!,695,4

mturk_agent_2,"In that case, I would like 3 firewood, 3 water and 3 food.",696,2
mturk_agent_1,"Of course, I cannot do that☹️. What do you need most and what do you need less of?",696,3
mturk_agent_2,I need firewood the most.,696,3
mturk_agent_1,Same. What do you need second most?,696,4
mturk_agent_2,water,696,4
mturk_agent_1,"Same. I'll give you two firewood, if you give me one. And you give me two water and you take the rest. The food we can split.",696,5
mturk_agent_2,"so I'll be 2 firewood, 1 water, 2 food?",696,5

mturk_agent_1,yes me and my family are going camping also. super excited; I was thinking i would get 3 waters and i will give you 3 foods. What do you think?,697,0
mturk_agent_2,"I don't mind giving up the 3 waters.  But, would you want to trade the 3 waters for 3 packages of firewood instead?  I'm heading up to the mountains and it's bitter cold at night.",697,1
mturk_agent_1,I would at least want to have 1 of the firewood. I would like to make sure my family don't get cold night,697,1
mturk_agent_2,We can do that I guess.  So you want to do the 3 food packages for 3 waters then?  Then...you would get one firewood?,697,2
mturk_agent_1,yes i would yes i would get 3 water and you get 0. I would get 0 foods and you get 3 and i get 1 firewood and you get two,697,2
mturk_agent_2,It sounds like we have a deal.  I'm so excited to be going camping this weekend.  I haven't done anything all summer because everything has been cancelled.  Has everything been cancelled by you too?,697,3

mturk_agent_1,I'm great! excited about camping :D,698,1
mturk_agent_2,I am too! Sadly I am not good at packing so im lacking some stuff,698,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, what did you need the most? I personally don't like hunting or fishing, so I need food the most.",698,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, haha. I m diabetic so I also need food the most, but if you are willing you can have most of the other stuff to trade off",698,2
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, I'm willing to work with you. I don't want you going into shock and dying when camping. That'd be awful!",698,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yea, I had that happened once. It was not fun. What else do you need so I can get a general idea of what you want",698,3
mturk_agent_1,I don't need firewood at all. I can find that anywhere. The water is my mid point. Go ahead and make an offer tho.,698,4
mturk_agent_2,"Oh okay, how about this. ill get 2 foods and 3 firewood and none of the water. sounds good? ",698,4

mturk_agent_1,How goes it?,699,1
mturk_agent_2,Everything is pretty great with me. And you?,699,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm doing pretty well, but found out that some of the food I had packed for my camping trip was expired, so I'm wondering if perhaps we can make a deal?",699,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh no ☹️. What type of deal would you like to make?,699,2
mturk_agent_1,Well I was wondering if you might be in the market for water?,699,3
mturk_agent_2,"I seem to have quite a bit of water, but I am in need of some firewood. Would you be willing to trade for that?",699,3
mturk_agent_1,"I have some spare firewood sure, I'm a little more hesitant to part with it but I can make it work!",699,4
mturk_agent_2,That's great. What did you have in mind?,699,4
mturk_agent_1,"If you're willing to give me 3 food, I figure I can give you 3 firewood and 1 water",699,5
mturk_agent_2,"It seems I misunderstood your problem. I thought you were getting rid of food. I don't have much food to spare, but I'd be willing to give you one package for 2 firewood and 1 water",699,5
mturk_agent_1,"Ah, well, if that's case and we're both short on food, I suppose I can let you have the 2 food then, although would it be possible to let me have the 2 of each of the other items then?",699,6
mturk_agent_2,That sounds resonable to me,699,6

mturk_agent_1,"I'm doing pretty well, just preparing for this camping trip.",7,1
mturk_agent_2,"ME as well! we are a group of big eaters, and are looking to take lots of food.",7,2
mturk_agent_1,That is fair as there is no showers or sinks at my campsite so I am looking to take water :) ,7,2
mturk_agent_2,We will likely also need to take water too. Need to be able to wash up.,7,3
mturk_agent_1,"That is fair, I also will need a good bit of firewood to keep warm as the campsite is in a colder area.",7,3
mturk_agent_2,We dont care much for campfires. Leaves your cloths smelling for days!,7,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hello, fellow camper.  Are you ready for our camping trip?",70,0
mturk_agent_1,I am ready to go camping. I understand there might be some disagreement around the additional supplies we each can choose from?,70,0
mturk_agent_2,"There could be.  However, I think that if we are both reasonable, we should be able to come to an agreement.",70,1
mturk_agent_1,I think so too. I have a medical condition - type 1 diabetes - that makes it important to bring extra water and food. I'd like to request more of those two items.,70,1
mturk_agent_2,"I don't have a problem with you having extra water.  I'll give you all the water, if I can have all of the firewood.",70,2
mturk_agent_1,I think that's more than fair. That only brings up the food to be divided. One of us is going to have to take less.,70,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'd be fine with taking less food.  So, I would get 3 firewood, 1 food, and 0 water.  Is that correct?",70,3
mturk_agent_1,"And I would get 0 firewood, 2 food and 3 water. That seems right to me.",70,3
mturk_agent_2,That,70,4
mturk_agent_1,"It looks like we have to continue this conversation beyond a certain point before we come to a deal, so - what is your most cherished camping memory?",70,4
mturk_agent_2,"My most cherished camping memory is of the camping trips that the church I used to go to planned.  One memory is when my son was driving a boat and was doing circles.  Somehow, a wave came over the front of the boat and soaked a friend of ours.",70,5
mturk_agent_1,Ha! That sounds wonderful. When I was young my mother and I hiked 75 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail over 13 days. It was an incredible bonding experience that really raised my level of confidence in what I could accomplish.,70,5

mturk_agent_2,Yes I am ready. But I am low on some item and I don't mind trading with you. Do you?,700,1
mturk_agent_1,No that sounds good. What are your preferences?,700,2
mturk_agent_2,I am so low on Food and I have two kids with me. The highest amount of item I have is Firewood. Do you mind taking some in exchange for Food?,700,2
mturk_agent_1,That matches up well with my needs. How about you take all the food and I'll take all the firewood. or we can go 2 & 1 if that better suits your needs,700,3
mturk_agent_2,Thanks for making this easy for me. I don't want you also to run low on supplies so soon. I will give you two firewood while I take 1 and half food. How about that?,700,3
mturk_agent_1,"That would be great but I don't think they let us break bundles in half. How does this sound... You get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood. I get 1 food, 2 water and 2 firewood. Sound ",700,4
mturk_agent_2,"You should understand that water is also essential for the kids. Likewise firewood to keep them warm. What about 2 foods for me, 2 firewood for you. And we all are happy and enjoy our camping?",700,4
mturk_agent_1,"here's what I propose to get a deal, you get, 2 food, 2 water, and one firewood. I get 1 food, one water and two firewood",700,5

mturk_agent_1,"For me it's food, with the extreme heat and my medical condition, having extra food is vital. How about you?",701,1
mturk_agent_2,"We all agreed that we want extra firewood, because we are going to higher altitudes and it's colder",701,2
mturk_agent_1,That works because where I'm going it's really warm so ,701,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would like at least one food if it can be spared. What about water, are you good taking all of that?",701,3

mturk_agent_1,"Ugh, I'm sorry to hear that ☹️ My friends and I plan on hiking a lot and I definitely don't want us to get dehydrated. Maybe I could take 2 waters, and I'd give you 3 firewood?",704,1
mturk_agent_2,"We actually have tons of firewood, more than enough really. I might be able to let you take 2 waters if we could have 3 foods? 🙂",704,1
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, which is more important for you? If the food is more important, I would be happy to give you three food, and I'd take 3 waters instead!",704,2
mturk_agent_2,"That is tempting, but I think I need to keep at least 1 water, since we have another person coming.",704,2
mturk_agent_1,Ah I see. How about you take 1 water and 2 food then?,704,3
mturk_agent_2,"Hmmm, I think I could do that, if I can also have 2 packages of firewood, since I will need it to cook the food! 🙂",704,3

mturk_agent_1,"i'm pretty good, how are you?",705,1
mturk_agent_2,Great!  I was wondering if you would mind sharing your top preferences on our three items?  What do you feel is your highest priority supply?,705,1
mturk_agent_1,"I suppose my highest priority is water, what do you think about maybe trying to split these up in an even way as possible?",705,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds great to me.  Excited for this camping trip.  My highest priority right now is food; I am bringing along a huge family and need to feed all of them, and they'll get super hungry without more packets!",705,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok that sounds good. So, I suppose that we can agree that we'll both receive at least 1 of each of the three different items.",705,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sure.  how about I could get 2 food packages since that is my highest priority, and you could get 2 water packages?",705,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds reasonable to me.,705,4
mturk_agent_2,Awesome.  And actually I would either be willing to have 1 water package and 2 firewood packages.  Would that be okay by you?,705,4
mturk_agent_1,"In that scenario, you'd be getting 1 extra item than me, but I'm not too worried about it because I'm sure if I needed to get extra firewood, I could find some in the wilderness.",705,5

mturk_agent_2,"I have the basic supplies needed, but there are definitely some things I could use more of.",706,1
mturk_agent_1,We are in the same boat. We have lots of water but sure could use some more food,706,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I definitely need some more food since I have several small children to feed.",706,2
mturk_agent_1,This is going to be tough if we both need food. I can trade you water for anything you don't need,706,3
mturk_agent_2,"I need the firewood the most, it is supposed to be very cold and I don't want the little ones to get frostbite or anything.",706,3

mturk_agent_2,I can only spare 2 food. Is that okay?,706,4

mturk_agent_2,Hi. What is the most important package for you? Mine is Firewood.,708,0
mturk_agent_1,Hey!  Excited for this camping trip.  For me I care the most about Water since I have a whole family with me and we didn't pack enough water,708,0
mturk_agent_2,I see. How about I give you the most package of water and you could give me the most for firewood? Then we could compromise and split the food evenly.,708,1
mturk_agent_1,That sounds pretty good to me from the get go.  I'd even be willing to do all 3 water packages for myself and all 3 firewood packages for you,708,1
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds fair to me, too. Although it looks like we can't evenly do a food swap. I'd be okay with giving you 2 packages and keeping one. That okay with you?",708,2
mturk_agent_1,"Absolutely, thanks for being so understanding.  Two food packets can help feed my hungry family here 🙂",708,2
mturk_agent_2,"Great! I'm in agreement, too. So I'll send over 3 waters. I'll keep all the firewood and send 2 food packages.",708,3

mturk_agent_1,I would like to have 2 food packages so that i can give them to my friends.,709,0
mturk_agent_2,I can agree to 2 food packages if I can have all three waters and 2 of the firewood. I want to have extra water for my dog.,709,0
mturk_agent_1,You can have 1 water and 1 firewood because i need atleast one water for myself and 1 firewood for me. Do you agree for this deal?,709,1
mturk_agent_2,I do not. What do you have planned for the weekend?,709,1
mturk_agent_1,Please agree for the deal.   I will be going out with my friends this weekend.,709,2
mturk_agent_2,"Thats really cool. I'm afraid I can't agree to the deal. ☹️ I really need as much extra water and firewood as I can get because I forgot enough water for my dog and he really needs it. I can agree to 2 waters,1 food, and 2 firewood for me.",709,2
mturk_agent_1,I think this deal sounds alright  to me.😮. But i have to think some more time whether this deal is ok. ,709,3
mturk_agent_2,Alright 🙂 What did you have planned for your firewood? Mine will be to keep my feet toasty. 🙂,709,3
mturk_agent_1,I have planned to use my firewood for cooking vegetables.,709,4
mturk_agent_2,"That is a good use. So can we agree on 2 waters, 1 food, 2 firewood to me?",709,4

mturk_agent_1,"☹️Oh, that sounds awful. Are you sure you need all three packages of firewood?",71,0
mturk_agent_2,"I might be able to get by with just two... I'm on a diet though, so I don't need as much food.",71,1
mturk_agent_1,That's a relief. I actually have a friend joining me and they don't have their own food supply. I don't have enough for two people.,71,1
mturk_agent_2,You can all the food if you need it.🙂,71,2
mturk_agent_1,Thanks!🙂 Do you need any water packages?,71,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes. Since the days are on the warmer side, I'm a afraid of getting dehydrated. I would love to have all of it...",71,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ah, that doesn't work for me. I would need to have at least one water because one of mine has a leak (and I have an extra person joining me).",71,3
mturk_agent_2,"I guess you can have one. That gives me 2 firewood and 2 waters, and you 1 firewood, 1 water, and 3 food. Right?",71,4
mturk_agent_1,Yes that would work for me. But I would also let you have all the firewood if I got 2 waters and all the food. ,71,4

mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like fun.  I am bringing my young son and want to make sure he is well taken care of so I want to make sure I have enough supplies to make sure he is warm and safe.  How about if I take 2 waters, 2 food and 1 firewood.",710,0
mturk_agent_2,Joe is bringing pleany of steaks so I can give all 3 he did forget the water through so maybe we can trade food for the water. 🙂,710,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I really don't feel comfortable with less than 2 waters, but since you will need the firewood to cook the steaks, I would be willing to give up the firewood if you want to let me keep all 3 food.",710,1
mturk_agent_2,Ok that sounds good to me. So I get 1 water and 3 firewood. 🙂,710,2
mturk_agent_1,Are you sure that all you want is steaks to eat.  You might need some other food to keep you going.,710,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm sure. We will be alright we are manly men LOL. 🙂🙂,710,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's good to know, but now that I am thinking about it, we might need some firewood if it gets cold at night, and you all being manly men won't need the heat as much as we do.  How about I give you take 2 waters and 2 firewood and I will take 3 food, 1 water and 1 firewood?🙂",710,3
mturk_agent_2,Umm. We are going to need all that fire wood we didn't Bing any sleeping bags.,710,4
mturk_agent_1,"That's too bad, but I can't risk not having any firewood to keep my young son warm at night.  Maybe you and Joe can collect some fallen branches to add to your 2 firewoods to make them last longer.😮",710,4
mturk_agent_2,This doesn't seem very fair to me at all.😡 You said you were willing to give up all the firewood if I would give up all the food. now you want more thing.,710,5
mturk_agent_1,I am just trading you 1 water for 1 firewood.  That seems very fair.😮,710,5
mturk_agent_2,"You get 3 foods, 1 firewood, and 1 water, I get 2 waters, 2 firewood and 0 food, That does not see fair. How about this I give you 3 food, 2 firewood, and I get 3 waters and 1 firewood.🙂",710,6
mturk_agent_1,"No, I can't be without any water.  If you insist on taking all the water, I will have to walk away.☹️",710,6
mturk_agent_2,Im trying to be really fair. 100% down the middle and you get more things than I do so my offer is more than fair. ,710,7
mturk_agent_1,"There are nine items so someone will get 4 and someone will get 5.  If getting more is important to you then you can have 1 food, 2 water and 2 firewood",710,7

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,710,8
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I'm camping, and I've been told I have plenty of supplies, but I've been camping many times in the past and no ""enough"" is never sufficient.

mturk_agent_1,okay fine but i need 2 pack of food and 2 pack of firewood,711,0
mturk_agent_2,"I see. Well, that would give me less than I want, but perhaps we can work something out. Which is most important to you?",711,1
mturk_agent_1,food is my high priority,711,1
mturk_agent_2,"How important to you is firewood? It's hot here, but I always nervous that I won't have enough firewood to cook my food. Would you be willing to give me 2 firewood?",711,2
mturk_agent_1,i don't have any back up for firewood. so i need at least 2 pack of firewood. instead i can give all my water pack to you,711,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I will definitely need all the water. I certainly can't give you 2 food and 2 firewood, and then water.",711,3
mturk_agent_1,if you okay to give 1 pack of food to me.instead 2 food,711,3

mturk_agent_1,"Unfortunately, I need more food too because all the food I brought has spoiled. I will be starving without more food. How about I take 2 food and you can have all 3 water?",712,1
mturk_agent_2,I really needed to have more packages of food as I have a condition where I can't let my blood sugar get too low and having more food would greatly help me with this. ,712,1
mturk_agent_1,"I will be willing to let you have 2 food if you let me have all 3 firewood, 2 water, and 1 food.",712,2
mturk_agent_2,The food deal sounds good but I also am in need of firewood. I need at least one firewood in the case of emergency I wouldn't want to be stuck freezing. ☹️ ,712,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, you can't have everything you want. I already conceded by letting you have more food. I think the deal I offered is fair since we both need food the most but I am letting you have more.",712,3
mturk_agent_2,"Maybe we can compromise on the water,  if I give you 1 food and all 3 firewood you can give 3 waters to me. ",712,3
mturk_agent_1,"Then you will need to give me 2 food. So I take 2 food 3 firewood, and you can have the rest.",712,4

mturk_agent_1,"Me too, do you have any priority items that you really need?",713,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm worried I did not bring enough water and there are no lakes or rivers around my site.,713,2
mturk_agent_1,"I know what you mean, water is really important for me aswell. How about firewood or food?",713,2
mturk_agent_2,It's warm and I have packaged food so firewood is not a priority at all. I wouldn't mind some extra food.,713,3
mturk_agent_1,so how about you get 3 foods and i get 3 firewood? That way we can get those off the table?,713,3
mturk_agent_2,I mean I really would like to get a lot of water and I am willing to give up all the wood.,713,4

mturk_agent_2,"I have been feeling sick, but glad to be here",717,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm sorry you've been sick!  So which item is most important to you?,717,1
mturk_agent_2,I would like the firewood to help me stay warm,717,2
mturk_agent_1,"I can see how that would be helpful.  No one likes to be cold.  I would really like the water, I have a baby to feed and need it for his bottles.",717,2
mturk_agent_2,How old is your baby :,717,3
mturk_agent_1,4 months old,717,3
mturk_agent_2,That is a fun age and must be fulfilling to you 🙂,717,4
mturk_agent_1,yes for sure! 🙂 he's my fifth baby.  What if we exchange the water and the firewood?,717,4
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good to me. How about 3 firewood and 2 food for me and 3 water and 1 food for you?,717,5
mturk_agent_1,"Okay I am happy with that deal!  You need more food to nourish yourself back to good health, after all.",717,5

mturk_agent_1,Holy cow family of 7! I can barely keep up with our family of 3 haha.,718,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that's the normal reaction I get BUT I seriously love this family. ",718,1
mturk_agent_1,Well that's great! I imagine you'll need extra supplies then. What would be most beneficial?,718,2
mturk_agent_2,"You can easily guess, its food!",718,2
mturk_agent_1,Haha yeah I figured. Shoots well I do need extra food as well. My son is 15 and seems to go through 15000 calories a day.,718,3
mturk_agent_2,I have 4 teenager younger boys sprouting everyday.,718,3
mturk_agent_1,"You must work four jobs. Okay you certainly have a legit reason so how's this... You take 2 of the foods, let me have all the water, and you can take all the firewood.",718,4
mturk_agent_2,Can I exchange a pack of water for firewood?,718,4
mturk_agent_1,I'll give you a pack of water for 2 firewoods then.,718,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,718,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,718,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello. I want to know if we could trade some things. I really need it for my family!🙂,719,0
mturk_agent_2,I also am open for trading. I really need water for my trip. What do you need the most?,719,0
mturk_agent_1,I really need water too🙂. How about I give an extra food pack for the water.,719,1
mturk_agent_2,"I don't really need food that much, I am already stocked up on it ☹️. How much do you need firewood? I can give you some of my food for it. 🙂",719,1
mturk_agent_1, I really need the extra water for my kid. I have four kids and they really get thirsty🙂. I can give you a bundle of firewood for the water.,719,2
mturk_agent_2,How about this: If I give you 2 waters you give me the 3 packs of firewood. The location is really cold and I think I can make 1 pack of water work with my family. 🙂,719,2
mturk_agent_1,I would need at least 1 firewood. I cant let my kids freeze. I am totally open to giving you 2 firewood bundles though🙂,719,3
mturk_agent_2,I can give you the two waters for 2 firewoods and 3 food packs. Would that work for your family?,719,3
mturk_agent_1,What would we eat?😮 I will take the deal minus 1 pack of food. How about that? So we can both enjoy our trip🙂,719,4
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good 🙂. So I give you 2 waters and you give me the 2 firewoods and  2 food packs? Good for both families 🙂,719,4

mturk_agent_1,I can't wait to get out of house this weekend.,720,0
mturk_agent_2,I know the feeling will you be traveling alone? ,720,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, this time it will just be me.",720,1
mturk_agent_2,I am hiking with my kids/,720,1
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds good, I'll be taking some long hikes myself. ",720,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes we will be out there three days. Going the easy trail with kids that is why I would like to make sure I have enough food.,720,2
mturk_agent_1,Long hikes make my hungry too. I like to have extra firewood to cook with.,720,3
mturk_agent_2,How is your water supply?,720,3
mturk_agent_1,I am pretty good with my water supply. ,720,4
mturk_agent_2,I am also. We are taking the longer trail but we do have the river.,720,4
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you 2 food, 1 firewood, and 1 water.🙂",720,5
mturk_agent_2,"I really need the extra food for the kids, I could go 3 Food 1 firewood and And one water. 🙂",720,5
mturk_agent_1,How about 3 food and one water. But no firewood.,720,6
mturk_agent_2,3  food 2 waters would be a little more fair.,720,6
mturk_agent_1,"OK, I can do that.",720,7
mturk_agent_2,We have a deal then.,720,7
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,720,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,720,8
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! How is it going? I would like to take 2 water, 2 firewood and 2 food. ",721,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi to you too! I am happy to give you 3 food units and 2 waters, but I really need three extra firewood. Can you do that?",721,0
mturk_agent_1,I would be willing to do 2 food units and 2 waters and 1 firewood. I would like the idea of being able to sit by a fire and use it for other purposes as well. 🙂,721,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh I agree about the fire! I need it because I have too high of a metabolism and do not retain body heat. Would you consider receiving 1 firewood, 1 water and 2 food?🙂",721,1
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry to hear about body heat issues. I drink a lot of water so would be willing to do 1 firewood, 2 water and 1 food. ",721,2
mturk_agent_2,Sounds great! So where have you camped in the past?,721,2
mturk_agent_1,Just some local campgrounds. Nothing to huge. How about you?,721,3
mturk_agent_2,"I go locally too. This way if I get too cold or wet, I don't have to travel to far to get home. 🙂",721,3
mturk_agent_1,That is a good way to look at it. 🙂 Are you able to catch food and cook on fire?,721,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yup, sometimes! Maybe I will see you out there sometime. Nice negotiating with you.",721,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,721,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,721,5
mturk_agent_2,"I am so pumped up about this camping trip.  Considering my party and our plans, we are going to need a lot of food and firewood!",722,0
mturk_agent_1,Hey there. I am going camping as well. I am excited but also worried. I want to make sure I have enough supplies..😮,722,0
mturk_agent_2,I hear you!  How many people are in your party?,722,1
mturk_agent_1,I have maximum permitted people per camping spot = 5 🙂 Do you have less or also maximum permitted?,722,1
mturk_agent_2,"We have 8 in our party.  While we have big plans, unfortunately, we have one member of the party that is severely allergic to lots of food.",722,2
mturk_agent_1,I get the whole food thing - this is what worries me the most - food. Because I myself suffer from condition to where I have to eat or snack multiple times a day and sometimes even night! I need to make sure I have enough food. But that is terrible for one member of yours because that means he/she might not even be able to eat the food provided?? 😮,722,2
mturk_agent_2,"It's going to be a real challenge for sure.  It sounds like food is high on our lists.  I may have a little wiggle room, but that means getting all the firewood as he is ok with most fish.  Means a little more work though!  😮",722,3
mturk_agent_1,The whole entire firewood😮. I think it depends where we stand on water? How much wiggle room on food?,722,3
mturk_agent_2,"Fortunately, we have an excellent source of fresh water near our camping site!  I would be happy to give you all of the water, while I take all of the firewood.  As for the food, how about I take 2 and you take 1?",722,4
mturk_agent_1,"Food is the most of my worry.. As I said - I constantly need to eat.. Wouldn't you party member, who is allergic, bring additional food since food provided is limited type? I would like to have 2 foods, please? Otherwise I can live with the rest of the deal even though I get cold very easy and would be sacrificing comfort if I give all firewood? But I would be willing if you give me all the food. My boyfriend is coming with me and he will need to keep me warm🙂",722,4
mturk_agent_2,"You are definitely testing me a bit here.  Food is also so very crucial.  I would be willing to make that exchange for one water just in case we change sites.  So, I get 3 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food?  ",722,5
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking for me either 2 food and 3 water and no firewood or 3 food and 2 water and no firewood or other wise I would take 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood?",722,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,722,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,722,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, have you been camping before? From prior experience, I know it's vital to have extra supplies for this trip. what are your thoughts?",723,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I have camped before and am looking forward to our trip! 🙂 I really enjoy a good, hot cup of coffee and would like to be confident that we'll be able to have a roaring campfire with as much firewood as we can. What do you think we should be able to take with us?",723,0
mturk_agent_1,"I too love a hot cocoa or tea, so we'll definitely need water, firewood is next up, and food is obvious 🙂 I think we can take as much as we are allowed. If you wanted, I could take all the food, we could split the water, and you could take all or most of the firewood?",723,1
mturk_agent_2,"I must admit that I prefer coffee over tea, but agree we need a lot of firewood to heat it up. I'm not sure we would be able to find enough dry material to burn, so would appreciate all of the firewood. Thank you!  As for water - I would agree with splitting it if I could have 2 please? 🙂",723,1
mturk_agent_1,"Am I to understand you want all of the firewood, and most of the water? That doesn't quite work for me, I would agree to all of the food, 1 of the waters if I could get one of the firewood? I will live without the extra cups of tea 🙂",723,2
mturk_agent_2,"You are correct.  I do propose that I take 3 firewood and 2 water.  I you initially asked to take all of the food which I would be agreeable to, but because I would have to solely eat off of what I find.  Therefore I think I need extra water to cook/boil what I find. How am I supposed to stay hydrated while foraging, since I wouldn't have any food?",723,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think it would be pointless to have food and nothing to drink. We should try and reach an amicable agreement tho, and based on our preferences being so similar, a rational split would seem most fair and favorable for the both of us. How about I take 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood?",723,3
mturk_agent_2,I think we are close to an agreement. Thank you for discussing this so openly!  Is your main objective to get at least 1 of each type of item?,723,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes it is, as I know one can't work without the other, especially out in the wilderness!",723,4
mturk_agent_2,I agree that they are all important. To help us both - what if you take 1 of each item and I carry the heavier weight of 2 of each?  That way you reach your goal of 1 of each item and don't have so much to lug around!  That would allow you to enjoy your camping trip so much better.,723,4
mturk_agent_1,"As generous as that sounds, I don't feel that deal is fair at all. My goal isn't one of each, but being a frequent camper, I know what I personally need to be out in the woods. I can also carry a good amount of weight, I'm a strong girl 🙂",723,5
mturk_agent_2,"I think we can agree on wood: you get 1, I get 2.  I think we can agree on food: you get 1, I get 2. Let's call those items as agreed upon.  We're down to negotiating on water I believe.  I'd hate for us to lose a great deal over 1 bottle of water. :( I really need 2 bottles of water please.",723,5
mturk_agent_1,"I'd hate to leave the deal too, the best I can go for is 2 of the food, 1 of the water, and 1 of the firewood if you really need the water. I can't do anything on 1 of each, I want you to have your coffee, but I have to think about me too ☹️ I can do 2 food, 1 water, 1 firewood. I believe that covered your preference of more water and firewood in your first request? I thought you'd be happy with that compromise ☹️",723,6
mturk_agent_2,"To confirm - you'll take 1 wood, 1 water, and 2 food?  I can agree to that.",723,6
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, and thank you for being so kind, a real gentleman 🙂",723,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,723,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,723,8
mturk_agent_2,Hey! I'm excited to go camping. 🙂🙂🙂,724,0
mturk_agent_1,"hello, me too I believe it should be fun I am just worried about having enough water",724,0
mturk_agent_2,"I know, I am worrying about the same exact thing!! ☹️😮",724,1
mturk_agent_1,"I was a boy scout in my teens and that would be the most important thing, firewood is easy to find and you can fish to get food usually.",724,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, and I hike a whole lot so I need to keep hydrated.",724,2
mturk_agent_1,"I love camping in the spring before the bugs come out, or in the fall when it is starting to get cool. What season do you think is best?",724,2
mturk_agent_2,"It's hard to decided. I do like camping in the spring, but the fall is generally just my favorite season.",724,3
mturk_agent_1,That is a very good time to go. Winter isn't bad but you have to keep warm and cooking can be harder.,724,3
mturk_agent_2,I completely agree with you. I would probably have to choose the fall. The leaves are so beautiful and the climate is perfect.,724,4
mturk_agent_1,Now I want to go camping. Do you want to deal with something more balanced? I am fine with a little more food for less water.,724,4
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, water is so important to me, so I will be willing to meet you in the middle. Can I take 2 waters, 1 food, and 2 firewood?",724,5
mturk_agent_1,That sounds very reasonable to me.,724,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,724,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,724,6
mturk_agent_1,Could you give me one of each?,725,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes let's try that for now,725,0
mturk_agent_1,I need firewood because it might get cold. Do you think giving me a third of the supplies is acceptable?,725,1
mturk_agent_2,I have a feeling you may get too cold if you don't have enough firewood ☹️ does this help?,725,1
mturk_agent_1,That helps. Thank you. I might get hungry after exerting myself setting stuff up and hiking during the trip. Do you mind giving me a third of the food supplies?,725,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can give you a third of the food supplies, and in exchange, I'll take the extra water supply. It's important to stay hydrated! 🙂",725,2
mturk_agent_1,Do you mind if I get one third of the water supplies? I might feel thirsty after hiking.,725,3
mturk_agent_2,"Good point. Let me give you a third of the water, and in exchange, I'll take one extra firewood",725,3
mturk_agent_1,Do you agree to get two thirds of each of the individual supplies then?,725,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I will keep two thirds of each supply, and you will receive one third of each supply",725,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,725,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,725,5
mturk_agent_1,I'm excited about this camping trip. I love to stay up all night look up at the sky and watching the fire burn.,726,0
mturk_agent_2,HELLO,726,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello. Are you excited about this camping trip?🙂,726,1
mturk_agent_2,"yes, really excited to go trip",726,1
mturk_agent_1,What is your favorite part about camping?,726,2
mturk_agent_2,camp fire,726,2
mturk_agent_1,I love camp fires as well. I love sitting around the fire telling ghost stories.🙂,726,3
mturk_agent_2,yeah it is very interesting to hear about ghost stories,726,3
mturk_agent_1,"So if its alright with you can I have 2 firewood, 1 water, and 2 food. That would give you 1 firewood, 2 water, and 1 food.",726,4
mturk_agent_2,i don't have any backup for firewood and food. can you give one more firewood and food?,726,4
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you 1 more food, which will give you 2 food, 2 water, and 1 firewood. But i really do love staying up all night and watching the campfire so i could really use the 2 firewood.",726,5
mturk_agent_2,oka fine,726,5
mturk_agent_1,Awesome and thanks.🙂,726,6
mturk_agent_2,thank you for your time,726,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,726,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,726,7
mturk_agent_2,Hi I would like to let you know that I could really use some extra firewood and food.  I was wondering if we could split it up with me receiving 3 firewood and 3 food and you get 3 water?🙂🙂🙂,727,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, that deal would not work for me. I am in need firewood too. 🙂 How about 2 waters for me, 2 firewood and 1 food for me?",727,0
mturk_agent_2,"Firewood is really my most needed item as I need it for several reasons.  Could we do 3 firewood for me, 3 water for you and then 2 food for me and 1 food for you?  This would really help me out.",727,1
mturk_agent_1,"I see, firewood is your most needed item. I thought food would have been because we all need nutrients. I have a need for firewood too.",727,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes it is highest priority as I need it to scare off animals as well as cooking food and using to purify water.  If you feel food is most important how about 3 Firewood, 1 food and 2 water for me and 2 food 1 water for you?🙂",727,2
mturk_agent_1,"I really need at least 1 firewood. How abour 2 firewood, 2 food and 0 water for you? I need to cook for my family and of course warm the bottle for my toddler.",727,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can understand why you would need 1 firewood.  I think i would need a water though, you don't want to let a fire just go in the wild.  So i think what about 2 firewood, 2 food, and 1 water for me and 1 firewood 1 food and 2 water for you and your family.  🙂",727,3
mturk_agent_1,I think that could work. I understand the need for the water especially around fire 🙂,727,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok it sounds like we have an agreement.  For me I would get 2 firewood, 2 food and 1 water.  You would receive 1 firewood, 1 food and and 2 water.  This sounds like a good deal for both of us.🙂",727,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, we have deal and we are walking away feeling good about what we agreed upon. The camping trip should be a great success. 🙂🙂🙂",727,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,727,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,727,5
mturk_agent_2,I am willing to take 1 food for 2 waters in return. I also find 2 firewoods acceptable. ,728,0
mturk_agent_1,"Unfortunately, I really need the water to take my medication. I would give 3 food in return for 3 water and 1 firewood.",728,0
mturk_agent_2,"I do not want to get dehydrated, so I want at least 1 water.  I can take 3 food and give you 3 firewood",728,1
mturk_agent_1,That works for me,728,1
mturk_agent_2,"Perfect, let me know if you want to make changes to the deal",728,2
mturk_agent_1,Could I have one food so I do not starve,728,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes in exchange for 1 firewood for myself so that I can either use it for warmth or make a hunting tool.,728,3
mturk_agent_1,I think I would rather have the firewood than the food though,728,3
mturk_agent_2,"Your, getting 2 firewood, 2 waters, and 1 food",728,4
mturk_agent_1,"I would rather have the previous deal with 3 firewood, 2 water, 0 food for me",728,4
mturk_agent_2,"That works for me. You can use the wood to capture animals, so you wont starve.",728,5
mturk_agent_1,Great idea. I love capturing animals and eating them,728,5

mturk_agent_2,i was hoping to get at least 1 food bag and 3 waters and 1 firewood if possible?,729,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, i figure if you are getting 5 items, i should be able to take 3 of my highest value items. which is food.",729,3
mturk_agent_2,then can i take 1 food and 3 waters?,729,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, then i can have 3 firewoods, and 2 foods. that is more than acceptable to me",729,4

mturk_agent_1,How about the deal? ,73,2
mturk_agent_2,Sure. My kids are really looking forward to this camping trip but one has special needs and he has to have a specific diet. I am fairly flexible on the water and firewood but food is a must have for me.,73,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay. then I'll choose 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water",73,3
mturk_agent_2,You want two food or you're allowing me to have 2 food?,73,3
mturk_agent_1,I want 2 food,73,4

mturk_agent_1,"okay then I'll choose 1 food 3 firewood, and 2 water",73,5
mturk_agent_2,It's a bit skewed towards you with all those items isn't it? If you want two waters then I'll need 3 food and one water. You can have all 3 firewood,73,5
mturk_agent_1,"Okay then I'll choose 0 food 3 firewood, and 2 water. you choose 3 food, 0 firewood and 1 water",73,6

mturk_agent_1,Which is your top priority?,731,1
mturk_agent_2,I will be camping in the desert so water is my most needed item. Which item is your top priority?,731,2
mturk_agent_1,I need water most also. How about you can have all of the water if I can have all of the food and 2 of the firewood?,731,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I am willing to make that deal",731,3

mturk_agent_1,sup. excited to go camping with my bros,732,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, me too! It's gonna be super cold where we are so I need lots of firewood. I hope you will take that into consideration. ",732,1
mturk_agent_1,"aw come on, we need firewood too 😡 ",732,1
mturk_agent_2,"damn, well lets see if we can work out a deal",732,2
mturk_agent_1,"sure, make an offer, I'll try to work with you",732,2
mturk_agent_2,"2 firewood, 2 food, 0 water for me? ",732,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, why not. You seem like you need it more than us",732,3
mturk_agent_2,"Awesome, thank you so much!",732,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, we're cool :D",732,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,732,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,732,5
mturk_agent_2,I would like to give you more food and firewood so that I can have more of the water. I am someone who gets very thirsty very quickly. I'm also a bit bigger than a lot of people and I sweat more as a result. 🙂,733,0
mturk_agent_1,"that is unfortunate, its quite hot here especially during the day, so I need all the water I can get",733,0
mturk_agent_2,"I understand that and sympathize. It's very humid and hot here as well. Does it get cold at night there? If so, the firewood would be very beneficial to you. ",733,1
mturk_agent_1,"its very cold at night, I can have all the wood and give you the food",733,1
mturk_agent_2,I would be okay with giving you two firewood but I need at least a little firewood for cooking and boiling water. ,733,2
mturk_agent_1,"I will take two wood, and two water, how is that?",733,2
mturk_agent_2,"No, I'm not interested in that because I really need the water. The food I'm okay with parting with more than the water. ",733,3
mturk_agent_1,I really need the water too.  its also my most valued item,733,3
mturk_agent_2,"It's mine as well. Since you need more firewood than I do I would be willing to give you two firewood, one water and two food.",733,4
mturk_agent_1,in that case I can take three wood and one water to be fair,733,4
mturk_agent_2,I think if you're getting two firewood and two food that you are still making out better on this deal even if you only get one water.,733,5
mturk_agent_1,"I have given up two of my most valuable items, you should be willing to sacrifice a little too, so its either I get three wood or two waters, and two foods",733,5
mturk_agent_2,"I won't be cold at night like you will though so the firewood is more important to you than it is to me. I still need at least one firewood to cook with but I'm willing to give that up. I will give you three firewood, one water and two foods. ",733,6
mturk_agent_1,sounds fair,733,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,733,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,733,7
mturk_agent_1,Hi there! Are you ready for your camping trip?,734,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am, but I am really worried that I don't have enough supplies. If I could get some extra supplies, my worry would turn into excitement! 🙂",734,0
mturk_agent_1,Me too! It's going to be cold this weekend so I'm worried about having enough wood to make fires.,734,1
mturk_agent_2,"I have the same worries ☹️  I wouldn't worry so much if it was just myself, but I have two small children, aged 5 and 7, plus elderly grandparents along with us.  I even have 3 dogs that are coming with us.  I'm afraid I'm going to run out of firewood and people will get cold.😮",734,1
mturk_agent_1,"Wow, that's a lot of people. Are you worried about food too? That's a lot of mouths to feed. ",734,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm mostly worried about firewood and water, I can fish for extra food, but I really need the firewood and water.",734,2
mturk_agent_1,Well what if I let you have the firewood but I take all the food and water then?,734,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about if you let me have all the firewood, plus one extra water and then you take all the food and leave me one water?d ",734,3
mturk_agent_1,Well then if you had water I would want at least 1 firewood for smores you know?🙂🙂,734,4
mturk_agent_2,"You always have to have smores, but now you made me want smores so I want an extra food too? How about I take 2 of the three firewood, one water and one food.  That gives you one firewood, 2 water and 2 food.",734,4
mturk_agent_1,Sounds like a deal!,734,5
mturk_agent_2,ok! Let's do it! have fun camping!,734,5

mturk_agent_1,That's awesome maybe we could trade 3 waters for 3 food.🙂,735,1
mturk_agent_2,"Actually,  I did not bring enough warm clothes and blankets and we need the extra firewood to keep us warm.",735,2
mturk_agent_1,I can spare some fire wood not a lot but some.,735,2
mturk_agent_2,"oh no, but I really need all that I can get. I am willing to give all the water you need in exchange",735,3
mturk_agent_1,I do not need water at all we have plenty.,735,3

mturk_agent_2,"ohh thats tough , i am going on a charity even with kids from the make a wish foundation. We could deffinatly use some water so the kids do not get dehydrated. they are already going through a lot , the least we can do is keep them hydrated ",736,1
mturk_agent_1,then i think we will need to split the water. I take 2 you take 1  for the kids.,736,1
mturk_agent_2,"ill take 2 for the kids since their lives are more important then shower water. but i can spare the food and firewood , so i could take 2 water 1 food and 1 firewood  , that will leave you plenty,, what is all the showering for?",736,2
mturk_agent_1,I have a condition. I sweat a lot. But you are right. Life is more important.,736,2
mturk_agent_2,"if it wasnt for a special charity event i could defiantly spare more water, but some of these kids need access to medication at all times so having water on hand to help with that is always a plus. sorry to hear about your condition. so 1 water 2 food and 2 firewood ok with you then? ill take 2 water 1 food and 1 firewood?",736,3
mturk_agent_1,Fair enough,736,3
mturk_agent_2,"ok, sounds good, glad we can make a deal",736,4

mturk_agent_2,Hey! Are you excited to camp?,737,0
mturk_agent_1,Most definitely!🙂 I haven't been camping in so long!,737,0
mturk_agent_2,Me either!  Would you mind sharing your top priority item so that we can come up with a fair way to distribute the extra goods? 🙂,737,1
mturk_agent_1,My top priority item is food. What is your top need here?,737,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh unfortunately my top priority item is food too, followed by firewood and then water",737,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, well that is a bit of an issue.. What I would be willing to do is to split the goods with all 3 firewoods for you, along with 1 food and 1water",737,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sure I think I am willing to do that as well.  Sounds like we will each get close to what we want, and compromise is never perfect 🙂",737,3
mturk_agent_1,"Excellent! 🙂 I'm so relieved to have such a cooperative partner here! And I couldn't agree more with your comment on compromise, and we do definitely get close to it though!",737,3

mturk_agent_2,"I'm excited, too! I think it's going to be fun. But I see we have these items. What do you need most of?",738,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes we do. I am going camping desert adjacent, so I need water.",738,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, that makes sense! I could give you all the water if you're willing to give me more of the other items. I could use food and firewood to help me stay nourished and warm.",738,1
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds fine, if i can have 3 waters, i will just take one of either food or firewood. ",738,2
mturk_agent_2,Would you do 3 waters and 1 firewood and I get 3 food and 2 firewood? I feel like that's pretty fair.,738,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that is fine by me, i am going by myself, so the food is not very important anyway. ",738,3
mturk_agent_2,I'm glad we could come to a deal. You were easy to negotiate with! We'll both have enough for our camping trip.,738,3

mturk_agent_1,Same here. I was hopping to get some extra water for the trip,739,1
mturk_agent_2,I have some water! I am looking for food ,739,2
mturk_agent_1,"There's plenty of Food, and I don't really need extra, I'm on a diet. ",739,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh that is great. I was wondering if you'd like to make a deal? I can trade 3 waters for 3 food? ,739,3
mturk_agent_1,"That could work, What do we do for firewood however? I was hopping to have a big fire tonight",739,3
mturk_agent_2,I could give you 2 firewood,739,4
mturk_agent_1,That would be wonderful,739,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,739,5

mturk_agent_2,Hello there I'm well. How about yourself?,74,0
mturk_agent_1,I'm good. I'm excited for the camping trip. I have been planning this for a few weeks. I'm excited to get out into the woods.,74,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh great! I love getting out into nature.,74,1
mturk_agent_1,"Do you have any preferences in regards to the firewood, food, and water? I would like us both to get what we need.",74,2
mturk_agent_2,I get really cold at night so I'd like to have extra firewood. ,74,2
mturk_agent_1,Same. Plus I am planning on keeping a fire long into the night. Eating alot of food also helps keep you warm while sleeping. Perhaps I could offer you some extra food in return for some extra firewood?,74,3
mturk_agent_2,Hmm I will have to think about this offer. How do you feel about the water packages?,74,3
mturk_agent_1,"I am a water junkie day to day but the place I am camping as a stream and I'm taking my water filter system, so I could offer you extra water in this case.",74,4
mturk_agent_2,That is very considerate of you. 🙂,74,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,74,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,74,5

mturk_agent_1,Hi! I'm really looking forward to this camping trip! 🙂,740,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello!  I am also looking forward to this trip.  What items would you like the most?,740,0
mturk_agent_1,"It's my husband's birthday, and I invited a few of his friends for a surprise party. I could really use the extra food!",740,1
mturk_agent_2,That actually might work out perfectly.  I wanted to go on a hike but it's supposed to be really hot outside and I could use the extra water to stay hydrated.  What do you think about me taking all of the extra water and you taking all of the extra food then we can disuss firewood?,740,1
mturk_agent_1,"That may work, depending on how you want to split the firewood. I would probably need at least 2 firewoods because we are doing smores instead of birthday cake.",740,2
mturk_agent_2,I think I might be able to do that.  Any chance of you giving me one food in exchange for the second firewood?,740,2
mturk_agent_1,"I can't, I really need all of the food, especially if you are taking all of the water. 🙂",740,3
mturk_agent_2,That is fair and I do appreciate you giving me all of the water as it is most important to me.  So are you okay with me taking three waters and one firewood and you taking two firewood and three foods?,740,3
mturk_agent_1,"That will work out perfectly! If you are camping near us, feel free to stop by for the party!! 🙂",740,4
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you, I appreciate that and that way we can share. :-)",740,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,740,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,740,5
mturk_agent_2,HI ARE YOU READY TO GO CAMPING? ARE YOU GOING ALONE WE ARE TAKING THE BABY,741,0
mturk_agent_1,"Actually, we're a group. The husband and I have our two and my sister's two, quite the PARTY 🙂 How old is your baby?",741,0
mturk_agent_2,SHE IS JUST ABOUT A YEAR OLD HOW OLD ARE YOURS?,741,1
mturk_agent_1,"A twelve year old girl, two ten year old boys and a five year old boy. You can imagine what it's going to take to feed this crew.",741,1
mturk_agent_2,god bless you LOL if you give me water i can give you some food.,741,2
mturk_agent_1,"Totally fair, another concern is Bonnie, the twelve year old, her sleeping bag is NOT GOOD and I'm afraid we don't have enough firewood to make it through the night. Quite frankly, she's ALREADY complaining.",741,2
mturk_agent_2,so i am porposing you give me 3 water 0 food 1 wood ,741,3
mturk_agent_1,You are a God Send!! I think that will work perfect! Is your daughter walking yet?,741,3
mturk_agent_2,yes she is a little not very safe but getting there,741,4
mturk_agent_1,"It's wonderful you're taking her out to enjoy camping. I hope she doesn't keep you up, sleeping in a new place and all.",741,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,741,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,741,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I think I should take two firewood, one food, and one water. ",742,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I hope we can work together to find an offer that benefits both of us. Do you agree?🙂",742,0
mturk_agent_2,I agree!,742,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, could you tell me which item is the most valuable to you?",742,1
mturk_agent_2,The firewood is most valuable to me because I get very cold at nighttime. Which is most valuable to you?,742,2
mturk_agent_1,My most valuable item is Firewood too since my knee is injured and I won't be able to pick it up at camp. And the least valuable?,742,2
mturk_agent_2,Water is least valuable to be because I can find my own water while camping. How about you?,742,3
mturk_agent_1,My least valuable item is food because I'm thin🙂,742,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I will need at least 1 firewood",742,4
mturk_agent_1,What do you think of this offer: I give you 2 firewood and 1 food and what is left for me.,742,4
mturk_agent_2,I would need 1 water just in case I can't find any drinking water,742,5
mturk_agent_1,"Remember that we already have the basic supplements for the camp, these are only extra items. And you have 2 of the most valuable, water is nothing for you.",742,5
mturk_agent_2,"There are a total of nine items, giving me 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water would still leave you with a majority of the items. ",742,6
mturk_agent_1,What really matters is not the quantity but the value of each item. Please collaborate.,742,6
mturk_agent_2,"I think what I am asking is fair in value. Let's pretend it's dollars. Firewood=3$. Food=2$. Water=1$. My 2 firewood, 1 food, 1 water would be 9$. Your 1 firewood, 2 water, and 2 food would also be 9$.",742,7
mturk_agent_1,We cannot pretend that because that is not how it works. I think you don't understand. Now i want 2 firewoods and 2 waters.1 food.,742,7
mturk_agent_2,"You can have 2 firewoods and 1 food, but only 1 water. ",742,8
mturk_agent_1,Im assuming we gonna walk away without getting a deal.,742,8
mturk_agent_2,Not if you work with me here. I am offering you what I was asking of you. 50/50 split of goods. ,742,9

mturk_agent_2,Nice! I'll give you all the food if I can have the firewood and water,744,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can part with the water, but I'd at least like some extra firewood to cook my food",744,1
mturk_agent_2,"OK, how about we split each of them? I'm thinking you could get 2 food, 1 firewood and 1 water",744,2
mturk_agent_1,I'd rather get the entirety of the food and 2 firewood if possible.,744,2
mturk_agent_2,I can't do that unfortunately. Seems like we both have those 2 as our top priorities! I can give you all the food but I'd need all the firewood and 2 waters,744,3
mturk_agent_1,"Which do you need more, firewood or water?",744,3
mturk_agent_2,Firewood,744,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, so you will get 3 firewood 2 water. I will get 3 food 1 water. is that fine?",744,4

mturk_agent_1,"🙂 Hi, how would you best describe your party needs?",745,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi! I could really use some water. I'm very concerned about my kids getting dehydrated. One of my kiddos really struggles with it. I could really use 3 extra waters. ,745,0
mturk_agent_1,I cannot spare a single water. I need all three waters because we have our grandparents who struggle with rheumatoid arthritis; they could die if they have no water. Could you give us all 3 of your waters?,745,1
mturk_agent_2,"Wow, that's asking a lot. For me to give you all 3 would be risky for me. The only way I would consider it is if you could give me all of the firewood and food. At least if I had extra firewood I could boil water out in the wild to help make up for the water I'm missing. ",745,1
mturk_agent_1,"Agreed to the firewood. We are at an impasse on the food situation. Our party also has a large number of folks, so we will need at least 2 foods. If we are giving you all our firewood, then we will need 3 foods because we will be unable to cook. I believe your children should be alright as long as your food satisfies their dietary needs.",745,2
mturk_agent_2,"I don't know that I could give you all the food. What about I get 1 water, 3 firewoods, and 1 food?",745,2
mturk_agent_1,You will need to give us all of your water for this amount of firewood and food. ,745,3
mturk_agent_2,"I will give you 3 waters, if you give me 3 firewoods and 2 foods. ",745,3
mturk_agent_1,I will give you 3 firewoods and 1 food if you give me 3 waters.,745,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I can make that work. ",745,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,745,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,745,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello.  I really would like two packages of extra food, one water, and one firewood.  How does this sound to you?",746,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello. I would like 3 packages of water, 2 firewood, and 1 food. ",746,0
mturk_agent_2,"I would really like one of the waters.  Could we come to a deal with you getting 2 waters, 2 firewood and 1 food?",746,1
mturk_agent_1,I am agreeable to that. I can compromise by giving you a water.,746,1
mturk_agent_2,Thanks. I thought extra food was the most important when camping,746,2
mturk_agent_1,Well in my case I wanted water most because I bring more food. And I like the firewood for cooking and I love campfires 🙂,746,2
mturk_agent_2,"Campfires are great, I only need a small one though.",746,3
mturk_agent_1,Good. Then it seems we can help each other out for mutual benefit,746,3
mturk_agent_2,"Exactly, it is so nice when negotiations go smoothly.",746,4
mturk_agent_1,I agree. Thank you for being reasonable. ,746,4
mturk_agent_2,Thank you!  Have a great camping trip 🙂,746,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,746,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,746,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I'm so excited for my camping trip.",747,0
mturk_agent_1,Me too!  I'm a bit nervous about having enough supplies.  ,747,0
mturk_agent_2,"Me too, but we can figure this out together. what do you need?",747,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm happy to hear that.  I do have a medical condition that requires me to drink a lot of water, so that if most important to me.",747,1
mturk_agent_2,"oh ok, that makes a lot of sense, I can give you most or all of my water, no worries.",747,2
mturk_agent_1,Great.  What do you need?,747,2
mturk_agent_2,I really need a lot of firewood because i'm camping in a damp and cold region and need a source of heat at all times.,747,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay.  Why don't you take 2 fire wood, 1 water, and 1 food.  Does that work for you?🙂",747,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, sounds good for me! ",747,4
mturk_agent_1,Okay.  Great!,747,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,747,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,747,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there! So, we're going camping!",748,0
mturk_agent_1,At least we're going somewhere 🙂,748,0
mturk_agent_2,"haha! yes!!! So, what are you interested in?!",748,1
mturk_agent_1,I definitely have enough food but forgot to bring any water. Water is most important for me. ,748,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay- that's good to know! Food is most important for me. I'm bringing a lot of my family, so the more food, the better",748,2
mturk_agent_1,Can I have all the water and you take all the food?,748,2
mturk_agent_2,"I still would like some water to have. I actually have a baby so need the water  for bottles, too. I'm happy to share all the firewood?",748,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds fair. Can I have 2 of the waters?,748,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think that sounds fair. You can have all the firewood and two of the waters. And, I'll have all of the food and 1 of the water?",748,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds perfect! Have a great trip!,748,4
mturk_agent_2,"Thanks, you too! 🙂",748,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,748,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,748,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, how ya doin' pardna? ",749,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I would like to make a good deal with you",749,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, we do have to come to a mutually beneficial arrangement I suppose... What are you most interested in today?",749,1
mturk_agent_2,"I need all the firewood possible, due to a cold crisis that we are going through in my home",749,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh really! ALL of it. I've heard that if you dig a deep enough hole you can get geothermal heat. Also, the excercise you get digging can certainly warm you up. Surely you don't need ALL of the firewood?",749,2
mturk_agent_2,"I have already looked for all the possible options, including your proposal, however, The problem is that my abula lives with us and she suffers from arthritis and I urgently need firewood to prevent her from continuing to suffer from cold.",749,2
mturk_agent_1,"The cold sounds like the least of her problems, but at least you won't need water because it would all freeze if it's as cold in your house as you say it?",749,3
mturk_agent_2,"What are your needs, what do you urgently need?",749,3
mturk_agent_1,"I don't know what campground you're at, but it's like a desert over here. I'll literally DIE from dehydration if I don't get as much water as possible. ☹️",749,4
mturk_agent_2,"Actually my main objective is Firewood, so much so that I am able to offer you the product you need in exchange for all the firewood you can offer me. Ok, I offer you all the water you need, what do you think?",749,4
mturk_agent_1,What do I think? I think that water doesn't replenish electrolytes so I',749,5
mturk_agent_2,"You are right, excuse me, but what I need is urgent, we will reach an agreement first. If you give me all the firewood, I will give you all the water?",749,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,749,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,749,6
mturk_agent_1,I have to get food as high while water is low.,75,0
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I have enough food, but I need firewood to keep warm and water because one of my containers leaked.  So, why don't you take all the food and I get everything else.",75,0
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, I'll agree with it!",75,1
mturk_agent_2,🙂 Ok.,75,1
mturk_agent_1,I can give you 1 thing of water and 2 things of firewood,75,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hmmm. So you will end up with 1 firewood, 3 food, and 2 water?  I think I need 1 more water and 1 more food. ",75,2
mturk_agent_1,I'll give you another water and food,75,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think we have a deal.  To confirm, YOU get 1 firewood, 2 food, and 1 water?  If yes, please confirm.  I think this sounds fair.",75,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yep, it's correct",75,4
mturk_agent_2,Ok.  I will submit the final offer.  I appreciate your offer. ,75,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,75,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,75,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello,750,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! 🙂,750,0
mturk_agent_2,"I was thinking, we could split everything up evenly.  I would take 2 firewoods, 2 waters and one food, you could take the rest.  ",750,1
mturk_agent_1,That's very kind of you. Would it be alright to give you three waters so I could have 2 bundles of firewood? ,750,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'd be happy to give you more waters, but I really do need two bundles of firewood.  We alwas have late nights when camping and I need to be able to keep my fire going.  How about If I take 2 firewoods 0 waters and 2 foods, and you can take 1 firwood anll 3 waters and 1 food?",750,2
mturk_agent_1,"I appreciate your offer, however I will be needing food for me and my friends so it would be nice to have the 2 food packages. You can have the two firewood so you won't run out of light. Would you take 1 water to put the fire out? I hope you wouldn't mind if I could have 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood and you can have the rest? 🙂",750,2
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds reasonable to me, I think we have a deal 🙂",750,3
mturk_agent_1,Wonderful! Deal it is! Thank you so much. Maybe next time you go camping we can all go and have fun? 🙂,750,3
mturk_agent_2,I think I would enjoy that very much!,750,4
mturk_agent_1,Great! Thank you again and have a wonderful trip!,750,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,750,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,750,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! Nice to meet you. I am interested in proposing a split among the extra items to take on the camping trip. I would like to take 3 food, 2 firewood, and one water. ",751,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello nice to meet you as well. That deal works fine for me? What do you need the firewood for?,751,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am prone to attract insects and I have found that the smoke from fire keeps them at bay, so I want the fire going as much as possible. Yes, I take frequent showers ;)🙂",751,1
mturk_agent_1,"🙂Thats good to know, I didnt know that fires keep insects away.",751,1
mturk_agent_2,"What are you going to do with the 2 waters in this deal, why are they more important to you?",751,2
mturk_agent_1,The waters are important because i like to make sure my kids are hydrated.,751,2
mturk_agent_2,"Very good, a family camping trip! Maybe I could give you all 3 waters and you could give me 3 firewood instead?",751,3
mturk_agent_1,Yeah i hope it is fun. Thanks but i like the first agreement we had .,751,3
mturk_agent_2,"Very well, I can live with that but thought I'd ask. You can change your mind if you wish. 🙂",751,4
mturk_agent_1,"🙂Thank you for asking but ill just stick to the first agreement we had. So you get 3 food , 1 water, and 2 firewoods.",751,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,751,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,751,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I was wondering if you needed any of the spare packages? I would love everything extra that we can get for our camping trip. 🙂,752,0
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, i am sure we can come to an agreement in how to split these things.",752,0
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds wonderful! To start off, I would love 3 extra packages of water in case anything happens. 2 of the food, and 1 firewood. Does that sound good to you?",752,1
mturk_agent_2,"Wow, that would mean you get 6 items, while i get only 3. That doesnt seem very fair. I would propose that if you are getting 3 waters, which i assume is your highest priority, i should get 3 Firewods and 2 foods",752,1
mturk_agent_1,Well what is it that you absolutely need for your trip? I am absolutely willing to negotiate! What you offered works for me.,752,2
mturk_agent_2,"Although, i would like water, as it is important in the hot climante where i am camping. I would be more than fine with the proposal i set out without any water. i think",752,2
mturk_agent_1,"I wouldn't mind giving you a water, if that means I could also have 2 firewoods and 1 foods. 🙂 But my top priority is definitely the water, I am always worried about a fire getting out of control, or getting lost. ☹️",752,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds good, i think we should just stay with my proposal then. i get 3 firewoods, and 2 foods",752,3
mturk_agent_1,"Perfect, sounds good to me! Hope you guys have an awesome trip 🙂",752,4
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds Good, i will await your submission. have a good trip as well.",752,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,752,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,752,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I'm thinking that I'd like all the water and the firewood.  I'd feel pretty secure if I had those supplies.",753,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello I would also like all of the water and the firewood. Water is important to me because I need it to live and I will also need firewood to stay warm on the trip.,753,0
mturk_agent_2,I get dehydated really quickly and then I'm just totally useless.  ☹️  How important is the extra food to you?,753,1
mturk_agent_1,Food is not as important to me as water and firewood. ,753,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, well that's the same for me.  😮  I feel like firewood can be used to secure potable water, and also helps with food, so it's extremely valuable.  What do you think about me getting two water, one firewood, and all of the food?",753,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would like 2 water, 2 firewoods, and 1 food if possible. If I have firewood I wouldn't need as much food. ",753,2
mturk_agent_2,"I don't think that distribution makes any sense.   We're both looking for water and then firewood.  In that scenario, it only makes sense that whoever gets more water than the other gets more of the other two.  What do you think of that?  You take 2 waters, but then I get 2 firewood and 2 food, the least desirable thing.",753,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me. Want to go with that? ,753,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I think that's fair.  Just to confirm (since I had a typo previously), you'd get 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food.  I'd get the balance, obviously.",753,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that is correct. I'll submit the deal now since I think we've reached 10 messages. ",753,4
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good.  Go ahead and submit the deal and I'll agree to it. 🙂,753,5

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,754,6
mturk_agent_2,"So I suggest that I get 3 food, 1 firewood and 2 water. Does that work for you?",755,0
mturk_agent_1,No it does not.  I'd like to do a proper negotiation.,755,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well I am a diabetic so I need lots of food to keep my sugar levels up, everything else we can negotiate on.",755,1
mturk_agent_1,I can do 2 packages of food.  I would want 3 packages of Firewood.  We can negotiate the water.,755,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'll need firewood as well since being a diabetic makes me pretty cold at times. So how about I get 2 food, 1 firewood and 1 water?",755,2
mturk_agent_1,"No how about 2 packages of food, 1 package of Firewood and 2 packages of water.",755,2
mturk_agent_2,Is that suggestions for you or me?,755,3

mturk_agent_1,"I would prefer to acquire more firewood, as the night are very cold. I would be willing to trade water for firewood.",756,1
mturk_agent_2,how much water would you give me for firewood>,756,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would be will to give up 3 waters for 2 firewoods. Also, I would give up 1 food along with the waters.",756,2
mturk_agent_2,how about 3 waters and 2 foods for 2 firewoods?,756,3
mturk_agent_1,That's quite a lot. Is there a reason you need more food?,756,3
mturk_agent_2,i get really hungry 🙂,756,4
mturk_agent_1,"I can well understand that. I get hungry also. I would give up 4 waters and 1 food, but I cannot give up 2 foods.",756,4
mturk_agent_2,"ok, i will give you 2 firewoods for 4 waters and 1 food",756,5
mturk_agent_1,Do you have any activities planned for during your camping trip?,756,5

mturk_agent_1,"I am good, how are you? ",757,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm doing great thanks!  My first priority is to get some extra water.  I stay very active and really try my hardest to drink a lot of water.,757,1
mturk_agent_1,I need lots of water too.  We're camped at an RV and there are no streams or available water sources.  Though we do have plenty of canned food in the RV ,757,1
mturk_agent_2,Sounds like perhaps we are placing the same value on things.  I do not need much extra food either.  I am not a big eater.  I would like some extra firewood as well however. ,757,2
mturk_agent_1,"Then yes, we are in the same situation.  I also place high importance on firewood and less so on food.  What's your proposal",757,2
mturk_agent_2,If I give you 2 water packages would you be willing to give me 2 firewood and 2 food packages?,757,3
mturk_agent_1,ok that works 🙂,757,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok great thank you for working with me 🙂,757,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hello I was wondering if you might accept me taking 2 Food, 2 Water, and 1 Firewood. I had an especially active day and really need the extra subsistence",758,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I can understand that but I am in the same position and I am really in need of water so what would you think if I keep 2 Water, 2 Firewood and 1 Food.  I get dehydrated very fast ",758,0
mturk_agent_2,As hot out as it is it's too bad we can't split the water 50/50. I don't get too cold at night would you like all the fire wood and I get all the food and just one water?  ,758,1
mturk_agent_1,"50/50 on the water would be great 🙂 You offer sound fair but I would not need all that Firewood, it is very hot here in the desert ",758,1
mturk_agent_2,Since you feel dehydated and most in need you should have the 2 waters then but I really could use the extra food my blood sugar feels low.,758,2
mturk_agent_1,"What about I take 3 waters, 1 firewood and you can have all the food and 2 Firewood 🙂",758,2
mturk_agent_2,I can't agree to that going without water completely is a health hazard☹️,758,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well we do have the starter kit, but ok then you can have 1 water, 2 firewood and all the food.  I feel generous today🙂",758,3
mturk_agent_2,Okay that is generous I agree,758,4
mturk_agent_1,It was a pleasure negotiating with you and I am so happy we agree and hopefully we will both have an awesome time ;),758,4

mturk_agent_2,"I'm doing okay! Kind of a slow day on MTurk, how are you?",759,0
mturk_agent_1,I am doing quite well actually. What supplies do you need?,759,1
mturk_agent_2,Firewood would be great! ,759,1
mturk_agent_1,I agree that it would be great. I didn't bring an axe though. So it is hard for me to get anymore.,759,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ah I see, do you have food then?",759,2
mturk_agent_1,I do have food. What exactly are you thinking?,759,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, what is it that you're looking for?",759,3
mturk_agent_1,"I need extra firewood and a little food. Since I didn't bring my axe, as I mentioned earlier, it is hard for me to get extra wood. I would like some food because I have an extra guest.",759,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, since firewood is a higher value item than food, I could trade you 2 firewood for 3 food in return?",759,4
mturk_agent_1,If you get all the food I would need all the water to barter with someone else.,759,5
mturk_agent_2,"How about one food and two water then, in exchange for 2 firewood.",759,5

mturk_agent_2,The basics of man -  food and water,76,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ah, okay, I could use some of that too! Which one do you need most?",76,1
mturk_agent_2,water. How about you?,76,2
mturk_agent_1,"I could use water, too, but I'd be willing to give some up if you give me more items overall",76,2
mturk_agent_2,What is your priority item to get the division started?,76,3
mturk_agent_1,"I would propose that I get 1 water, 1 food and 3 firewood and you would get 2 water and 2 food",76,3
mturk_agent_2,I don't mind the division but I would like a pack of firewood added because my family of 7 consume this item as well during the day & night,76,4
mturk_agent_1,"you would have to give more items up to get firewood. if you get more water, which is our highest item, i need more of other items",76,4
mturk_agent_2,"How about 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood?",76,5
mturk_agent_1,"I don't really need food, to be honest. Food is the least of my worries.",76,5
mturk_agent_2,"how about 1 water, 1 firewood and 3 food ?",76,6
mturk_agent_1,For you?,76,6
mturk_agent_2,yes. I am yet to know your priority. Which I guess should be either water or firewood,76,7

mturk_agent_1,"Hi! Lol nice to meet you too... I'm going camping too, but I'm taking the whole family, and teenage kids mean we need a lot of food 🙂",760,0
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I'm willing to give up one of my food packages because you are taking a large family. I'd like to have an extra water package to stay hydrated since I'm an active person who likes to run.",760,1
mturk_agent_1,"I would prefer to have all of the extra food packages. You can have 2 of the water, and I'll throw in all three of the firewood if you're down for that",760,1
mturk_agent_2,I think that is a fair deal but I'm not ready to give up one of the food packages just yet. I will need the extra food because of a high metabolism. Would you be willing to trade a firewood package for it? You might need it to cook some of your extra food. :) Do you camp often? Would you be able to enjoy camping in extreme climates?,760,2
mturk_agent_1,"I have, as a matter of fact, enough times to know that there's not a lot firewood can do that a portable generator and a space heater can't. I've got those, and I'm fine eating cold food, because I'm camping out in the desert. How about you? Are you sure you don't want that extra wood?",760,2
mturk_agent_2,I think you make a good argument and I am reluctantly willing to give away the 3 food packages. 😡 The rest of the deal seems fair as well. 🙂 I've always had good experiences camping and I could use the extra firewood for heat since I enjoy camping in cold weather climates.,760,3
mturk_agent_1,So aside from me getting the 3 food? How would you like to split up the rest? I'd like to get at least 1 water if I could.,760,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I'd like to get the other 2 packages of water in the deal we made earlier. I don't know what the weather will be like and could use all the water I can get since I will perspire most of it. 🙂😮",760,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ok. Then let me propose that I get 3 food and 1 water, and you get 2 water and 3 firewood.",760,4
mturk_agent_2,That sounds great! I will submit the deal. Hope you have a nice day and best of luck on your camping trip! 🙂,760,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,760,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,760,6
mturk_agent_1,I will give you all the food and 1 water for the firewood.,761,0
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, I am not comfortable with that. The weather is colder than expected and having a family of 7 leads to higher consumption of firewood.",761,0
mturk_agent_1,That is my main concern also. What is your biggest need? ,761,1
mturk_agent_2,High need for firewood,761,1
mturk_agent_1,"hmm, that is also what I need. What kind of compromise were you thinking? 🙂",761,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can offer 1 package of firewood, 1 package of water and 2 food going by family's consumption volume",761,2
mturk_agent_1,How about 1 firewood and 2 water and 1 food? That gives you more of what you need most but at least I can keep my kid and dogs hydrated well. ,761,3
mturk_agent_2,ok,761,3
mturk_agent_1,"Great, I am glad we came to an agreement",761,4
mturk_agent_2,Nice negotiating with you,761,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,761,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,761,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi! I  hope you are doing good. I would like to ask few packages for the tripping?,762,0
mturk_agent_1,Sure.  I would like to have 2 of each item.,762,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm not okay with that I will be needing 3 water, 2 food and 1 firewood, and 0 water 1 food and 2 firewood it is ok?",762,1
mturk_agent_1,"No, I'll accept all the firewood and 2 food though.",762,1
mturk_agent_2,"I can go for 2 water, 2 food and 1 fire wood and the rest you can have, As a big crew is coming along.",762,2
mturk_agent_1,"I'd like to get as much firewood as possible since the weather report says it's going to be cold.  2 firewood, 2 food and 1 water for me, rest to you?",762,2
mturk_agent_2,"that would be hard deal, for me food is essential for all can you please share one more, so I will have 3 water, 2 food and 1 firewood",762,3
mturk_agent_1,"I shouldn't have a problem with water, since we'll be camping near a spring but would like one just in case.  3 firewood, 1 food, 1 water for me?",762,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can accept but you can give 1 firewood, which will save us from cold? will you?",762,4
mturk_agent_1,I have to have 2 firewood minimum.,762,4
mturk_agent_2,I can accept if you can give me just 1 firewood? and 2 water 2 food for me and rest for you? so that both us will be beneficial,762,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,762,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,762,6
mturk_agent_1,I would like to offer you all of the water and one additional package of food.  I will take the firewood and 2 pckages of food.,763,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello. Thank you for your offer, however that will not be a good deal for me or you as water is important to have on a camping trip. Have you been camping before?",763,0
mturk_agent_1,"Yes.  If rain is in the forcast, I can collect rainwater.  What is your counter offer?",763,1
mturk_agent_2,"I understand, but if it does not rain you will have to think about that. I offer that I can take 2 firewood, 2 food, and 1 water. Therfore, you can have 1 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water. 🙂",763,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's kind of you, but I have small children and need to make sure they stay warm at night.  How about you take 2 water, 2 food, and 1 firewood?  I will take 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food.",763,2
mturk_agent_2,"In the case, wouldn't it be better if you take more food and water, since children can get more hungry and they tend to go to bed earlier, so you wont need as much firewood. What is your priority for the trip of items to have? I generally like to stay away very late in the evening to watch the stars, which is why I am leaning more towards more firewood than water. ",763,2
mturk_agent_1,"That's interesting.  Looking at the stars is very entertaining.  However, children can get hypothermia rather quickly.  Also fire keeps predators away.  Therefore, I would prefer more firewood in order to keep my children warm and safe.  ",763,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can understand that, but that is why its important to bring more blankets to protect them. In that case, what if I take 1 firewood, 3 food and 2 waters and then you can have 2 firewood and 1 water since firewood seems to be that much more important for you. ",763,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sadly, blankets don't protect against most predators.   I am again offering you 2 water, 2 food, and 1 firewood.",763,4
mturk_agent_2,"It seems that we both prefer to have firewood the most, so I think if that is the case and you take more firewood, then I think that I should have more of something else as I've stated above. Dont you agree?",763,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I do agree.  There are 9 items available; I am offering you 5 and I get 4.  ",763,5
mturk_agent_2,That is fine by me. ,763,5
mturk_agent_1,Great.  I am glad we can agree 🙂,763,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,763,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,763,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you today?",764,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm doing well. How about you?,764,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm good, excited to get this camping trip underway! 🙂",764,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm excited as well! I'm hoping to be able to pick up a few last minute items for the trip. ,764,1
mturk_agent_1,Me too!  What kind of items are you looking for?,764,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would like to get extra food, firewood, and water. I had a few things change last second, so I'm worried I won't have enough for the trip.",764,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry to hear that!   I am looking for some items too, maybe we can help each other out.",764,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that sounds like a great plan. I think working together is our best option. I'm hoping to get some extra food. I had an extra person decide to join last second, and I'm worried I won't have enough. My friend has never been camping before, so I want to give them the full experience. I'm worried they will hate it if we don't have enough food. ☹️☹️",764,3
mturk_agent_1,That is always a big worry.  I am feeling exactly the same about water.   Would you be willing to trade food for some water?   I'd be happy to give 3 food for 3 water.,764,4
mturk_agent_2,"What about firewood? I injured my shoulder yesterday, and now I won't be able to cut my own once I get to my campsite. ☹️ Do you think you could throw 2 firewoods in?",764,4
mturk_agent_1,I think I could do that.  2 Firewoods and 3 water for 3 Food and 1 Firewood?,764,5
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that's a deal. ",764,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,764,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,764,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I could really use some firewood and water. Would you mind if I take all of the firewood and some water. You can have the rest.",765,0
mturk_agent_2,No thanks. I'll give you all the Food because I am skinny. I need all the water and firewood for myself to make a tasty stew. ,765,0
mturk_agent_1,"I have plenty of food stocked up, but I am really running low on firewood and water. We will need to make compromise on the firewood and water.",765,1
mturk_agent_2,I'll give you two firewood and 1 water and 1 food. That way you get more of your top item. ,765,1
mturk_agent_1,That is a much better deal. I agree to these terms.,765,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok sounds good. We need to talk a bit longer to submit the deal though. How are you?,765,2
mturk_agent_1,I'm doing pretty well. Just surviving in the wild and stuff. You?,765,3
mturk_agent_2,just doing nature things. Going on hikes and swimming. What was your negotiation strategy like?,765,3
mturk_agent_1,I just wanted to negotiate a deal that was agreeable for both parties. You just happened to make a deal that was good enough for me.,765,4
mturk_agent_2,Ya I just wanted to get a fair bonus for both of us. Great negotiating. ,765,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,765,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,765,5
mturk_agent_1,hello,766,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi,766,0
mturk_agent_1,ready for the camping trip?,766,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I am excited 🙂",766,1
mturk_agent_1,"i am too, it is going to be really nice",766,2
mturk_agent_2,Sure is. ,766,2
mturk_agent_1,"though i do think i am going to need some more firewood, you think you can help me with that?",766,3
mturk_agent_2,I can give you firewood in exchange for a bulk of the water since I am trying to go on a water fast diet.,766,3
mturk_agent_1,ya it can be very cold at night and the extra firewood can help with that. i do have some extra water for you,766,4
mturk_agent_2,Great. That is a fair compromise. How much did you have in mind to exchange? ,766,4
mturk_agent_1,3 for 3?,766,5
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good. So I give you 3 firewood and you give me 3 water?,766,5
mturk_agent_1,correct,766,6
mturk_agent_2,I can work with that. Now how would we divide the food? 😮,766,6
mturk_agent_1,"i feel food should be kept the same, we both need it",766,7
mturk_agent_2,I don't think we can divide the 3 packages of food equally right?,766,7
mturk_agent_1,"ya, we don't have to trade food",766,8
mturk_agent_2,I think we may have to trade it. We still have to decide how much each both of us gets. Cause if you put 0 then that will give me all 3 food packages I think.,766,8
mturk_agent_1,oh you are right,766,9
mturk_agent_2,Yep. If you don't care too much of food do you mind if I keep 2 packages and you get 1 because I feel kind of hungry now. 🙂,766,9
mturk_agent_1,"i feel i can just walk away if that's the case, i am trying to set up the deal here and could use the extra 1 food",766,10
mturk_agent_2,Walking away would be worse off for both our cases wouldn't it? Even if you got what you desired of 3 firewood and 1 food wouldn't it still be better than walking away?,766,10
mturk_agent_1,"sometimes i can be stubborn like that, especially with food",766,11
mturk_agent_2,Ok I guess I will give in and you can have 2 food then. ,766,11
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,766,12
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,766,12
mturk_agent_2,"I forgot to bring any water, can I take two of them? ",767,0
mturk_agent_1,What will you be using for? Would I be able to have two packages of food and 1 package of firewood?,767,0
mturk_agent_2,"I get heat stroke and faint easily, so I need to stay hydrated. You can have two packages of food, I have enough already. ",767,1
mturk_agent_1,Great. Sounds like a deal. What about the firewood so I can make a fire. I can boil my water from river to use to cook and clean.,767,1
mturk_agent_2,You can take one package of firewood to make the water and I can take two so I can cook the food I brought? 🙂,767,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you. That will be very helpful to be able to cook. I think we are all set. I will give you the 2 packages of water, you get 2 of the firewood and you get 1 package of food.",767,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like a deal! ,767,3
mturk_agent_1,Great. Are you good to submit the deal?,767,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes everything looks good. Thanks for being understanding. ,767,4
mturk_agent_1,Great..thank you for helping.,767,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,767,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,767,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I would like to have 3 packages of firewood.",768,0
mturk_agent_2,"I would be willing to give you 2 packages of firewood, if you give me three packages of food and two packages of water",768,0
mturk_agent_1,"I can give you three packages of food, however I would want three packages of firewood and 2 packages of water",768,1
mturk_agent_2,How about I give you three packages of firewood and one package of water instead,768,1
mturk_agent_1,What would you need two packages of water for?,768,2
mturk_agent_2,I am on medication that tends to make me very thirsty and extra water would help,768,2
mturk_agent_1,"That seems important for camping, I can take that into consideration",768,3
mturk_agent_2,why would you need two packages of water?,768,3
mturk_agent_1,"I would need two packages of water because I am going on an extended camping trip, and the extra water would help keep me hydrated for the entirety of the trip",768,4
mturk_agent_2,It looks like we both have valid reasons for wanting the extra water 🙂. But we need to come to an agreement. How about I give you the two packets of water in exchange for one packet of firewood?,768,4
mturk_agent_1,"How about you give me 3 packets of firewood, and one packet of water as I think you deserve to have the extra water!",768,5
mturk_agent_2,and I still get three packages of food?,768,5
mturk_agent_1,Yes,768,6
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, you have a deal. Thank you so much!",768,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,768,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,768,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how's it going?",769,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, it's going well. Let's discuss how to split up the items, shall we?",769,0
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, sounds good. What items are most important for you?",769,1
mturk_agent_2,"I was hoping to get a fair amount of the firewood and the food, what about you?",769,1
mturk_agent_1,That sounds fine to me. I would like to get as much water and firewood as you think is fair.,769,2
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, maybe I could get two firewood and you could get one? I was hoping to make a campfire with them. 🙂",769,2
mturk_agent_1,If you want two firewood then I would like to request 3 water and 2 food then. This is my kid's first camping trip and they are looking foward to making s'mores and it's going to be tough with only 1 firewood.,769,3
mturk_agent_2,"I don't mind giving you all 3 waters, but would it be possible for me to get 2 food? I was planning on hiking and I need the extra fuel for my body. ☹️",769,3
mturk_agent_1,"My kids are going to be disappointed, especially since we won't have that much firewood. You sure you can't spare 2 food?",769,4
mturk_agent_2,"Oh gosh, I don't want your little ones to go hungry. I guess it's only fair that you get 2 food.",769,4
mturk_agent_1,"hey that's great, I really appreciate it. I'll send over a proposal.",769,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,769,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,769,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, it is nice to be going camping. I do not have a very good sleeping bag and I can get cold at night. It would be nice to have extra firewood. I dont eat much so I do not need much extra food. Would you be willing to give me two packages of firewood for a package of food?",77,0
mturk_agent_1,"I enjoy camping as well. However, my campsite seems to be a bit chilly at night. I'd be willing to part with some firewood, yet I'd need quite a bit of food to compensate. I also have a stream nearby so water is plentiful if you need that as well.",77,0
mturk_agent_2,I may be able to do something with regards to food. Do you have enough water?,77,1
mturk_agent_1,I have more water than I need. How is your water supply?,77,1
mturk_agent_2,"I could use some more water as I get dehydrated easily. Since you have enough, I could give you and extra package of food for your water.",77,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds like a deal, what would you like to do as far as the firewood goes?",77,2
mturk_agent_2,I really need to keep warm with my not so good sleeping bag.☹️ I would be willing to do this. I get two packages of firewood and three packages of water and I will give you two packages of food and one package of firewood. You have plenty of water so you will not miss that.. ,77,3
mturk_agent_1,"This sounds good to me, unless you would be able to part with three packages of food?",77,3
mturk_agent_2,"No, I would like to keep one for me just in case I need it. If it sounds good to you can we finalize the agreement and move on. I think we have something that helps us both.🙂",77,4
mturk_agent_1,That works for me 🙂,77,4
mturk_agent_2,Great! Thank you,77,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,77,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,77,6
mturk_agent_2,Nice to meet you! Are you getting excited to go camping?!?!,770,0
mturk_agent_1,I sure am!! 🙂 I am most excited to eat smores at the camp fire. Do you happen to have any extra firewood?,770,0
mturk_agent_2,That sounds really fun! I would love to help you with those smores. I can give you all my firewood if you can give me all of your water.,770,1
mturk_agent_1,That is really generous of you - Thanks! That works for me. How should we split the food?,770,1
mturk_agent_2,I was just going to mention food...I don't have any and would really appreciate as much food as is available.,770,2
mturk_agent_1,"I understand that. Since I have smores to eat, I am happy to give you two of the food. Is that okay? ",770,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that works! That is fair! 🙂",770,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I hope you have fun camping! 🙂 It was nice meeting you!",770,3
mturk_agent_2,Enjoy those smores! 🙂,770,4

mturk_agent_1,"I love camping, im super excited",771,0
mturk_agent_2,So do I! I am looking to gather some more supplies for my super duper exciting camping trip. I see you are as well. What sort of items are you looking for the most?,771,1
mturk_agent_1,"I get scared at night so i was really hoping for some extra firewood, how about you, what is important to you?",771,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ahh, I am an excellent chef! And to cook I will also need fire to make some delicious meals to keep me cozy and warm. Extra firewood and food is important to have for me. What do you feel about additional food and water?",771,2
mturk_agent_1,"I dont really need water, it seems like we both need the same things, so how about one gets onew firewood and two foods and the other one gets two firewoods and one food? then we can decide on the water",771,2
mturk_agent_2,"That does sound quite reasonable. Because you are scared at night, I think having additional light and warmth from fire will be good for you. What do you think?",771,3
mturk_agent_1,"That is very generous of you, so how about i get two firewoods and one food and one water, and you get the rest? That way you will get 5 items since you are helping me out with my fire.",771,3
mturk_agent_2,"Because I am such an inspired chef, I think it would be beneficial if I took 3 additional food packages. That way I can make sure I have enough supplies to practice making some really complex outdoor meals. Would such a deal be possible? 😮",771,4
mturk_agent_1,"I am ok with that if i get two waters, just incase i have to put out the fire 🙂",771,4
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds good. So you will get two firewoods and two waters. That sounds excellent to me 🙂 you seem like a great person, my friend",771,5

mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how's it going?",772,0
mturk_agent_2,Good!,772,0
mturk_agent_1,It's brutally hot here. I'm so looking to go camping this weekend where there's a lot of tree cover lol.,772,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oof, I get that. I'm trying to go camping too actually. I definitely need some extra water before I go, though.",772,1
mturk_agent_1,yeah I need water as well. but the kids are really looking forward to making s'mores and reading ghost stories by the campfire,772,2
mturk_agent_2,Is there anything you feel like you need? It sounds like you could use some extra firewood,772,2
mturk_agent_1,If you want 3 water then I can take 3 firewood. They kids are active so maybe I can take 2 food?,772,3
mturk_agent_2,Honestly that sounds like a fair deal to me 🙂 I'm camping just with my partner so we probably won't need quite as much food as you.,772,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok cool that sounds good to me. I'll send over a proposal for 3 firewood, 2 food and 0 water. That's ok?",772,4
mturk_agent_2,"That means I'll get 3 water and 1 food, yes? I will agree to that.",772,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,772,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,772,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi 🙂. What are you preferences regarding the items?,773,0
mturk_agent_1,"I am going to be going to the desert. I am going to be needing the water, since there is very little there",773,0
mturk_agent_2,Oh I understand. I have a medical problem that causes me to perspire a lot and am a bit overweight so I was hoping to get some additional bottles.,773,1
mturk_agent_1,I can understand the having the issue with perspiring since I will be in such a hot climate. ,773,1
mturk_agent_2,How much food do you think you'll need? I'd like to get some additional food again due to medical issues (diabetes). ,773,2
mturk_agent_1, Yes. You will need food with that condition. You would not want your sugar to drop to low. ,773,2
mturk_agent_2,Definitely. What about firewood? I don't think you would need a large amount being in the desert? I'm going camping but it rained recently so the wood would be pretty much useless for fire.,773,3
mturk_agent_1,"I will need the firewood for the desert, since it is so hard to find there. I would think 2 food and 2 water for you, would be a nice amount. That way you have your water and food. ",773,3
mturk_agent_2,Thanks that's very generous of you. 🙂,773,4
mturk_agent_1,"Would you like to go with two water and two food for you. I will take one water, one food, and the 3 firewood. ",773,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,773,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,773,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, I would like to have some extra supplies. I am really a coldy cat and could use the extra firewood. How about...I take the extra firewood and 1 extra package of food and water.",774,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi! It looks like we're interested in the same supplies. I get really cold being anemic. Would you consider taking one extra firewood, 2 packages of food, and one water?",774,0
mturk_agent_2,I am sorry to hear you are anemic. I guess I could make camp with 1 extra bundle of firewood.I am ok with the 2 packages of food but I would like 1 extra water than . I have a weak stomach and need to cook everything in potable water.,774,1
mturk_agent_1,"I appreciate your willingness to part with the firewood. Why don't we agree to switch the water and food, so that you end up with 1 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water packages?",774,1
mturk_agent_2,I really could use the 2 food packages though. I am having a friend coming over to visit. I did not count on him.,774,2
mturk_agent_1,"If you had to choose only one, would you prefer to have more food packages or water?",774,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well...since my friend has a healthy appetite 🙂 and has a iron clad stomach, I would prefer the food packages .",774,3
mturk_agent_1,"OK, I need a few minutes to consider how important these packages are to me. I appreciate how patience and courteous you are being. ",774,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok. Take your time. No problem at all.,774,4
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, if you'd agree to me taking all the firewood, you can have all of the food packages and all of the water ",774,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,774,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,774,5
mturk_agent_1,hello my friend i will like to suggest to you if i can get 2 food 1 firewood and 1 water.let me know what you think,775,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello 🙂 We are camping in the desert near Joshua Tree NP. While your offer is fair, I am hoping to take three waters. I could give you another food package in return.🙂",775,0
mturk_agent_1,okay but i will be needing water too i you give me 2 water 2 food and 1 firewood ?,775,1
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry that won't work. 🙂 I prefer your first offer to that one. My greatest need is water and firewood.  I can offer to give you the three food and 1 firewood.  That is better than your first offer, as far as I can tell. ",775,1
mturk_agent_1,okay so i take 3 food 1 firewood 1 water while you take 3 water 2 firewood and 2 water.please is this okay by you?,775,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes you can take three food and one firewood.  I need the water and firewood.  We will be doing a lot of hiking with a large group and it will be in the 90's with full sun.  We also need the firewood to keep warm as the desert gets cold at night.,775,2
mturk_agent_1,okay can you spare 1 water for me as well while you take 2?,775,3
mturk_agent_2,"No, I can't spare it.  It is dangerous to hike in the anza-borrego desert without ample water.  There are no convenience stores or natural water sources to rely on either. 🙂",775,3
mturk_agent_1,okay that is fine so i take 3 food 1 firewood while you take 2 firewood and 3 water .i hope we have come to a conclusion?,775,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I am ready to finalize. You?",775,4

mturk_agent_2,"Yes, Totally i want 2 water and 1 food",776,2
mturk_agent_1,What are you thinking about as far as the firewood? ,776,3
mturk_agent_2,i already have so i don't need additionally,776,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, so let me get this straight. You take 2 water, and 1 food, and I'll take 2 food, 3 firewood, and 1 water? Is that right?",776,4
mturk_agent_2,"okay, fine.",776,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,776,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,776,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I hope you are well.  I have a metabolic issue that requires me to eat a lot of food.  So I would like all 3 of the food items.  What is your preference?",777,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I'm well. That sounds like a serious issue, I would be willing to give up all of the food for all of the water and then some firewood to make up for the food I won't have. I'll be camping in the desert with little water and extremely cold at night. Thoughts?",777,0
mturk_agent_2,"So lets see, i need a little water.  How about I get 1 water and 1 firewood",777,1
mturk_agent_1,Could I have all of the firewood then and then you can have one the waters along with the food? I need to make sure I have enough to stay warm at night.,777,1
mturk_agent_2,Can I have one firewood? I have to stay warm?,777,2
mturk_agent_1,I guess I can give up one firewood in exchange for one food. There's really no resources where I'm camping and if I don't have enough I'm out of luck.,777,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would rather keep the food and give up the firewood. So how about I get 3 water, 1 food, and no firewood.",777,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry water is absolutely my priority. How about this, 3 water for me and 1 firewood, and then 2 firewood for you and 3 food. That way you have more resources overall to address to your metabolic issue. ",777,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about 2 Food for me, 1 water, and 1 firewood",777,4
mturk_agent_1,I need water over food. If you're going to take what I need most I need more resources overall to make up for it.,777,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, I will accept your deal of 3 food for, 2 firewood, and no water?",777,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,777,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,777,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hello there. I'm thinking about how to split these extra resources we have lying around. How about I take 3 food and 2 water, and you can have the rest?",778,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello. I am worried about that because I was hoping to get 3 food, as I get very hungry and need to eat or snack multiple times per day and even night. 😮 That worries me . I was hoping to get 3 food but I would be willing to do 2..",778,0
mturk_agent_1,"Well, that puts us in a bit of a pickle. Personally, I like to bring along a bit more food because serving sizes can be a bit misleading, but I totally get where you're coming from. However, I'm also hoping to get at least 2. Wouldn't you be interesting in water and firewood instead?",778,1
mturk_agent_2,I could take 2 food and give you all the water? ,778,1
mturk_agent_1,"Oh no, I couldn't take all the water myself. I'll be fine with just 1 or 2 water. Would you be fine with 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood?",778,2
mturk_agent_2,I would the best be fine with 3 food and 2 firewood and 1 water. But I could do 2 food and 2 firewood and 1 water. Or 2 food 1 firewood and 2 water. ,778,2
mturk_agent_1,"I'm glad that we're on the same page regarding firewood and water, but I really don't think I can be flexible with food. I'd really like to get at least 2 food.",778,3
mturk_agent_2,Then I would take all the firewood? And all the water?,778,3
mturk_agent_1,You can have all the firewood and water as long as I get all 3 food.,778,4
mturk_agent_2,I would still need food. I spoke of mine condition. I am useless at camping site if I do not get to snack/eat something every few minutes.,778,4
mturk_agent_1,"In that case, I'll take 2 food and 1 water. You can have all the firewood, 2 water, and 1 food. Sound good?",778,5

mturk_agent_2,"Yes.  However, I could really use some more water.",780,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm in the same boat, unfortunately. I have a medical condition that requires me to stay really hydrated. Why do you need extra water right now?",780,1
mturk_agent_2,"I had hoped to do some hiking, and I tend to get dehydrated really easily.",780,2
mturk_agent_1,What else do you need a little more of on this trip? Maybe we can find a way to get this shared as equitably as possible. 🙂,780,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'd like some firewood.  I really don't need any extra food, as long as I have plenty of water.",780,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I'm happy to give you ALL of the firewood, and I'll take the food, if that works for you. Will you let me have two of the waters?",780,3
mturk_agent_2,"I had hoped for more water, but you said that you have a medical condition.  Hopefully, the weather will be cool for hiking.  At least there are lots of trees, and lots of shade.",780,4
mturk_agent_1,Great! I love to hike and I'm hoping to do a few hundred miles of the Appalachian Trail next year. Do you have a favorite hiking spot?,780,4

mturk_agent_2,I appreciate the invitation but I am going camping on my own with my friend at that time. And we will be in a different location. ☹️,781,0
mturk_agent_1,"OK, we understand. We'll have our grandpa with us and he needs all 3 waters for his rheumatoid arthritis, and since his bones get cold we'll need all 3 firewood. Is this OK?",781,1
mturk_agent_2,"No, that is not okay. ",781,1
mturk_agent_1,You will receive all three foods. We will take no less than 2 firewood and three waters.,781,2
mturk_agent_2,I don't need food. I have canned goods. I need firewood and water too. We will be in a tundra and will freeze to death without fire. And all the water in the area is frozen. I will take all the firewood and 1 water. You can have all the food and 2 waters. ,781,2
mturk_agent_1,No. We will take 1 firewood. All the food. 2 waters.,781,3
mturk_agent_2,"There are 9 items. That means one person gets 4 things and one person gets 5 things. Not six and three. Because you are being greedy, you can take 1 fire and all the food. I'll take 2 firewoods and all the water. ",781,3
mturk_agent_1,Walk-Away,781,4
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I hope you are ready for your upcoming camping trip.  I am prepared but really dislike camping ☹️.  I was hoping you could help me get some supplies that will make my trip a little better. ",782,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I am ready and I love campaign. But I have some requirements. Hope you help me to get the supplies.",782,0
mturk_agent_1,I hope I can help you too 🙂.  Personally I tend to get cold very easily and would like to have all the extra wood to keep me comfy cozy during my trip.  What items would you like to take on your trip?,782,1
mturk_agent_2,I love to help you. But need more woods as I have Nyctophobia (fear of dark). I experience it more during darkness. Hope you understand it.,782,1
mturk_agent_1,"I understand that you are afraid of the dark.  I would be happy to share the wood with you for sure. I will only take one of the wood and give you the rest, if you would be willing to give me an extra share of food.  ",782,2
mturk_agent_2,That's kind of you. I will provide 1 wood and 1 food. Hope you will be satisfied. ,782,2
mturk_agent_1,Could you provide me with 2 food since I was willing to give you a larger share of the wood?  I would also be willing ot give you all of the water in this deal.  ,782,3
mturk_agent_2,Sorry. Try to understand please.,782,3
mturk_agent_1,"I am willing to give you the larger share of wood because of your fear of the dark. I will also concede and give you 2 food, but then I must ask for all the water.  Since I gave so much in this deal can you at least give me this?",782,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello!,784,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi there!,784,0
mturk_agent_2,Our camping trip is coming up. I could like to get two packages of food and 1 of firewood and 1 of water.,784,1
mturk_agent_1,I think that is fair. Do you have a preference between firewood and water?,784,1
mturk_agent_2,"I prefer the firewood. I always get cold very easily and then I can't sleep. If that happens, my trip will be ruined☹️",784,2
mturk_agent_1,I understand and can imagine what you are feeling. I am usually thirsty when I go on camping trips and am worried of hydration.,784,2
mturk_agent_2,I totally understand that. How do you feel about the food packages?,784,3
mturk_agent_1,I think water and food are important to me. I am warmblooded and don't need much to stay warm.,784,3
mturk_agent_2,So what do you think is a fair deal?,784,4
mturk_agent_1,"What do you think about me getting 3 water, 1 food, and 0 firewood? Does that work for you?",784,4
mturk_agent_2,yes that works!,784,5
mturk_agent_1,"Ok deal! To clarify, you would get 0 water, 2 food, and 3 firewood. Is that correct?",784,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,784,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,784,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you?! I am requesting the following supplies, to be submitted. I'd like to submit to you that I am a larger person so need extra supplies, not a selfish person! 🙂",785,0
mturk_agent_1,"That's great to hear! I'm also not a selfish person so hopefully we can come to an agreement. While I'm not a larger person, I do get hypoglycemia and low blood sugar so I'd like to request getting the 3 extra food supplies and offering you the 3 extra water supplies. Are you interested in that kind of deal?",785,0
mturk_agent_2,I'd hate for you to have any issues on your camping trip! I'm not interested in walking away with no extra food but am willing to talk. Are you interested at all in the firewood?,785,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I am open to discussions. Yes, I'm interested in the firewood. Are you at all interest in the water?",785,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I could do 3 water, you get 2 food, and I take 2 firewood since I'm really a little paranoid about wild animals and want extra to keep fire going all night. ",785,2
mturk_agent_1,"Two food sounds good, but if you are getting 3 water I would want to take 2 firewood. I would be worried about not having enough supplies if I took any less.",785,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can live with the food and water we have here. But I'd really like to take 2 firewood. Since you will have 2 food, you can save me from, at least, the worry about myself turning into food. We can finish this up if you could settle for just one firewood. ",785,3
mturk_agent_1,"I can't be happy with you getting 3 water, 2 firewood and 1 food for a total of 6 supplies while I only get 2 food and 1 firewood for a total of 3 supplies. I will walk away before agreeing to that. I'm willing to take 3 food and 1 firewood or I can also agree to 2 food and 2 firewood. Either way you are still leaving with more supplies than I am. If neither of these are good, maybe we should renegotiate using the waters. Let me know what you think?",785,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, that is a reasonable answer, I don't want us both to end up empty handed. Let me ask, what type of place are you camping in? In other words, what is the terrain that you are planning on setting up camp?",785,4
mturk_agent_1,I'm going to be camping in desert terrain. There won't be trees for cover or resources nearby so it's important I bring everything that I need.,785,4
mturk_agent_2,"I think I can live with that then. You get 2 food, 0 water, and 2 firewood. I get 1 Food, 3 water, and 1 firewood. Are you in agreement with this?",785,5
mturk_agent_1,"Yes I can agree to that! 2 food, 2 firewood and 0 water for me. 1 food, 3 water and 1 firewood for you.  I have already made water arrangements for my trip so I'm not very concerned about the water. I think we have finally come to an agreement!",785,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,785,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,785,6
mturk_agent_1,"I think the weather for me is going to be pretty cold. can I have all of the firewood, and I'll give you some of the food and water?",786,0
mturk_agent_2,"The only way I could possible make that work is if I got all of the water and 2 of the foods. If I don't have the firewood, I'm going to need to bring more food and water because I won't be able to cook/boil as much ☹️",786,0
mturk_agent_1,would one firewood help?,786,1
mturk_agent_2,"So I would get 1 firewood, 3 waters, and 1 food?",786,1
mturk_agent_1,"Could we do it where you get 1 firewood, 2 waters and 1 food?",786,2
mturk_agent_2,No I don't feel like thats going to be enough water for me with only 1 firewood. I can't risk not having enough water. My dad just had heart surgery and I have to make sure he doesn't get dehydrated. It could be very dangerous without it. ☹️,786,2
mturk_agent_1,i can't really go without water either. I have a baby and I need to make her formula.,786,3
mturk_agent_2,"If I get 2 firewoods, 2 waters, and 1 food, I can probably make it work. ",786,3
mturk_agent_1,"could I give you 1 firewood, 1 water and 2 food?",786,4
mturk_agent_2,I feel like this deal just keeps getting worse for me. I won't take less than 2 waters. ,786,4
mturk_agent_1,My last offer did have two waters.,786,5
mturk_agent_2,"So how about I get 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 1 food. ",786,5

mturk_agent_1,what is your top preference,787,1
mturk_agent_2,Water as i'm diabetic and extra fresh water is important for my health,787,1
mturk_agent_1,"I have health conditions as well, so i really need enough food to stay well.",787,2
mturk_agent_2,"That's fair, I have no problem with you taking most if not all of the extra food",787,2
mturk_agent_1,"Me too, I am more than happy to let you take most of the water. I hope we can make a fair deal to help each other out🙂",787,3
mturk_agent_2,"Same here, what's your thoughts on dividing the firewood?",787,3
mturk_agent_1,"let's do this quickly, i don't mind taking 1 and you take 2.",787,4
mturk_agent_2,"OK, no argument here. How is my taking 2 waters and you 1?",787,4
mturk_agent_1,"how about you take all 3 water, and i take all 3 food",787,5

mturk_agent_1,I'm looking to cook a meal for everyone during the trip so I'm looking to make sure I have enough firewood to keep the fire going. ,788,1
mturk_agent_2,"That's fair! If you'd like, you can have all of the firewood! I'm looking to avoid passing out during this trip - keeping hydrated helps! What if I have the water and you get the firewood?",788,1
mturk_agent_1,That works with me. I would like to get some extra food as well. Are you cool with me getting 2 packages of food and you taking 1?,788,2
mturk_agent_2,Perhaps! How many people are you cooking for?,788,2
mturk_agent_1,Probably 10 of us,788,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, that sounds fair to me, then. I will only have 5 people.",788,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok. So I take firewood, you take water, and then 2 food for me and 1 for you.",788,4

mturk_agent_1,"Hmmmm that sounds reasonable, is wood your lowest priority?",789,1
mturk_agent_2,yes that's correct. ,789,2
mturk_agent_1,I think this is a fair deal. i do like how upfront this went.,789,2

mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I'd like to take all of the food and 2 of fire wood. You can have the rest.",79,0
mturk_agent_2,I really need food too so if I can have 2 packages of food you can have 1 package of firewood and all 3 of the water.,79,0
mturk_agent_1,😮That does not work for me. May I have 3 packages of food and one package of water. You can have the rest.,79,1
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, but I definitely can't accept not having any food. I'll take 1 package of food, and all of the firewood and then you can have the water.",79,1
mturk_agent_1,Okay then shall I take 2 packages of food and all the packages of water?,79,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, and I'll get 1 package of food and all of the firewood.",79,2
mturk_agent_1,Okay I think this might be a good deal. ,79,3
mturk_agent_2,"Actually, I've just thought about it and I'd also like one package of water. I think it'd be fair being that you're getting 2 packages of food.",79,3
mturk_agent_1,Which means? Did you mean that I would take 2 packages of food and 2 packages of water? Then I will ask for one package of fire wood.,79,4
mturk_agent_2,"Being that you're getting 2 of 3 of the item (food) that for me is the highest value, I think it's only fair that I get all 3 of the medium value items (firewood) and one of the low value item (water). That would give me 5 packages and you 4 packages, but 2 of 4 of your packages are the high value items.",79,4
mturk_agent_1,Okay then. I agree with you.. Shall we finalize our deal. I will take the 2 packages of food and 2 packages of water.r.🙂,79,5
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I find that an acceptable deal.",79,5
mturk_agent_1,Okay. Nice to meet you. Have a nice day🙂,79,6

mturk_agent_1,hello!,790,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you?",790,0
mturk_agent_1,Am fine what about you?,790,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm doing well.,790,1
mturk_agent_1,wow great,790,2
mturk_agent_2,"There is one thing, I am thinking that I might need some extra firewood, because it is supposed to get colder than I expected. Would you be interested in trading me some, for something else?",790,2
mturk_agent_1,yeah i can give you 1 firewood and 3 waters in exchange for 3 foods and 2 firewood,790,3
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, I don't think I could give up 2 firewoods and 3 foods. I don't really need water much. If I give you 2 firewoods, I would need 3 foods.",790,3
mturk_agent_1,you cant have it all.Is either you give 3 and gain 3.I will give yo 3 food and you give 2 firewood and all water,790,4
mturk_agent_2,"I'm not trying to take everything 🙂 How about I give you 2 firewood and 2 water, and I get 1 firewood, 3 food and just 1 water?",790,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,790,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,790,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hi! I am good at gathering/ catching food, so if i get the firewood, it will help me to cook what I catch",791,0
mturk_agent_2,I see.  I in particular require lots of water for subsistence.,791,0
mturk_agent_1,"hm. well, I also want some water to cook with. food i don't really need.",791,1
mturk_agent_2,I want a rolls royce.  That doesn't mean I should get a Rolls Royce and a BMW.,791,1
mturk_agent_1,"haha, that's true. but still, I'm wondering, if i give you all the food and two waters, would you let me have one water?",791,2
mturk_agent_2,"That seems like a decent starting point, I would be willing to share one water because I am not a monster. 🙂",791,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ah! thank you, yes! 🙂 out of curiousity is the food of any value to you?",791,3
mturk_agent_2,"A little bit, but I would be willing to give you all the firewood, I can keep warm enough.",791,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, perfect! so it sounds like we have a deal, huh?",791,4
mturk_agent_2,"So you get 1 water, 0 food and 3 firewood?",791,4
mturk_agent_1,Yes! thats it!🙂 Sounds good to me.,791,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,791,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,791,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how are you, I'm really excited about my trip, how about you?",792,0
mturk_agent_2,I am excited as well 🙂! I can't wait to finally get some fresh air!,792,0
mturk_agent_1,"Me too! Speaking of which, I'd really like to be able to have as long of a fire as possible, sing songs and stuff. I'd like all the extra firewood, I'd be okay with only one extra food and water.",792,1
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, ironically I was going to ask the same. The site I camp at is very cold at night, not to mention all the food I brought requires cooking ☹️. Maybe since we both are in need of wood we can keep it, but I may require an extra water. I'd be willing to lend an extra ration of food for it however. ",792,1
mturk_agent_1,"So I would get 3 firewood, no water and 2 food?",792,2
mturk_agent_2,"My bad, I misspoke. I'm still getting over my cold so please forgive me. I am proposing this-I would get 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food. You would get 1 firewood, 2 water and 2 food. How does that sound? ",792,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sure, I am good with that deal.",792,3
mturk_agent_2,I am happy about that! I hope your trip goes great and you get much needed relaxation! ,792,3
mturk_agent_1,same to you,792,4
mturk_agent_2,I am sure I will have a great camping trip!,792,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,792,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,792,5
mturk_agent_2,"I can trade 2 packages of food, 1 package of water, and 1 package of firewood.  How does that sound to you?",793,0
mturk_agent_1,I sleep kind of cold at night so I'd really like to get as much of the firewood as possible.  Staying warm is a high priority for me.,793,0
mturk_agent_2,Would you be able to trade a bit more water for more firewood?,793,1
mturk_agent_1,I could give you the water if I could get the firewood.  I drank a lot of water before I came here so I think what we get as basics would be fine.  I also don't mind just washing up from a river.,793,1
mturk_agent_2,That will work well for me I do a lot of hiking and I build up a large thirst.  I don't get terribly cold at night and I can find other resources to build a fire.,793,2
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds great.  So we're discussing you getting three bottles of water, 1 food?",793,2
mturk_agent_2,I prefer two bottles of water and 2 for food.,793,3
mturk_agent_1,I think that sounds agreeable to me. 🙂,793,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok and you can have two of my firewood. I can get an insulated sleeping bag and I'll be sleeping in a decent tent.,793,4
mturk_agent_1,I'd really prefer to get all the firewood if possible.,793,4
mturk_agent_2,I think we have a deal 2 firewoods for you and 2 foods and 2 waters for me.  Is that a deal?,793,5
mturk_agent_1,"I was hoping for 3 firewood for me, 3 water for you, and I'll take 2 food.",793,5
mturk_agent_2,"I would need at least one firewood in case the temps drop.  You'd still be getting the majority of my firewood.  I can have 1 food, 2 waters, and 2 firewoods.",793,6
mturk_agent_1,"Not sure I can make that work.  I'd be willing to take 3 firewood and 1 food if that makes things easier for you, leaving you with 3 water, 2 food.",793,6
mturk_agent_2,I think you would need water more than food just in case you can't drink the water.  My final offer to you is 2 firewoods and I would have one remaining.,793,7
mturk_agent_1,So you want me to get just 2 firewood and 1 food?,793,7
mturk_agent_2,"No you would have 2 firewoods, 1 water, and one food.  I would have 2 foods, 2 waters, and 1 firewood.  Or I can just have one of each.",793,8
mturk_agent_1,"You can have two water, 1 food, 1 firewood if you must do it that way.",793,8
mturk_agent_2,That works just fine for me do we have a deal? 🙂,793,9
mturk_agent_1,I can make that deal work.,793,9
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,793,10
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,793,10
mturk_agent_2,hi there🙂,794,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi🙂,794,0
mturk_agent_2,I think that we should distribute the packages equitably and evenly to the extent that we can,794,1
mturk_agent_1,I really need food because my family loves to eat,794,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, well I really need water because I get whoozy if I do not get enough. I also sweat a lot",794,2
mturk_agent_1,"You can have all the water, if I can have all the wood and food",794,2
mturk_agent_2,"How about 2 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood for me?",794,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about 2 water, 1 firewood, and 0 food, I really need that food",794,3
mturk_agent_2,"That sure is a lot of food.  We are bound to need a boost as well. How about 3 water, 2 firewood🙂",794,4
mturk_agent_1,"You can have 3 water, 1 firewood, zero food🙂",794,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,794,5

mturk_agent_1,"Hi! So it's time to go camping! It's gonna be a hot day here, how about you?",795,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I'm actually going to be camping up in the mountains, so really cold here! ",795,0
mturk_agent_1,I would love that but you get what you get haha. I really want to make sure I have tons of water. Can I have all 3?,795,1
mturk_agent_2,You can have all 3 water if I get to have all 3 firewood?,795,1
mturk_agent_1,Yeah I'll totally do that! ,795,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok that's perfect, now with food I'm of course fine with a more even split. Well as evenly as you can split 3 haha",795,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah I wish we could do halves. Tell you what, take two foods. It's hard to eat a lot when its super hot out.",795,3
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you, thats true! The cold is definitely gonna make me want to eat plenty of warm food ",795,3
mturk_agent_1,I hope we both have good weather! Enjoy your trip and be safe.,795,4
mturk_agent_2,You too!! 🙂 ,795,4

mturk_agent_2,Hi! It's nice to meet you.,796,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello! Nice to meet you to! What are you thinking about the camping trip coming up?,796,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm excited 🙂 And I see we have some items that we need to split up.,796,1
mturk_agent_1,What do you need the most for your trip?,796,1
mturk_agent_2,Food and water would be ideal. I tend to go through food quickly and I need to stay hydrated. What about you?,796,2
mturk_agent_1,"Food is my number one priority. I'm not certain if I will be able to hunt where I'm going and/or I also don't know about the natural food available (berries, mushrooms, etc). Water would be a close second for me too.",796,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would be willing to give you more food if you give me more overall. Something like you get 2 food, 1 firewood and 1 water and I get 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood.",796,3
mturk_agent_1,"Could I do all three food in exchange for all water to you and 1 firewood to me, 2 to you?",796,3
mturk_agent_2,If you want all three food I would need everything else back. Food is my highest value item and I'm giving up a lot to give it to you.,796,4
mturk_agent_1,"How about this: 2 food to me, 2 firewood to me, 1 water to me. Rest to you?",796,4
mturk_agent_2,I can't do that. That is giving you more food and more overall.,796,5

mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,796,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,796,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,796,7
mturk_agent_2,Hello there! I am looking for extra supplies!🙂,797,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello. I am also hoping to get extra supplies. I am anemic and have low blood sugar so I really need extra food. I am willing to give you all of the extra water in exchange for all of the food.,797,0
mturk_agent_2,"I need food too unfortunately. So, how about I get one food while you get two?🙂",797,1
mturk_agent_1,I think that is fair but then I will need 1 water and you can have 2.,797,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, that is fine with me! 🙂",797,2
mturk_agent_1,Now lets talk about the extra firewood. Because I have a low immune system is it possible I could have 2 firewood and you can have 1.,797,2
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I am fine with that too! I can bring a jacket! 🙂",797,3
mturk_agent_1,Oh good. I hope we both have a fun camping trip. I know I am looking forward to it. I hope you stay warm!,797,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, thanks! 🙂",797,4

mturk_agent_2,hello,798,0
mturk_agent_1,hi,798,0
mturk_agent_2,which items are you most interested in?,798,1
mturk_agent_1,I really need food and water for my trip deep into forest.,798,1
mturk_agent_2,"i'll need food also, but you could have 2 of the waters.",798,2
mturk_agent_1,"Thats a generous offer but given the location of the research facility I have to hike to and my current condition that is i am in need of constant hydration due to some medication, do you think if I give you all the firewood and 1 of the food items, you could let me take all the water and 2 of the food items? It would really help me out.🙂",798,2
mturk_agent_2,"i will need at least 1 water. here's my offer: you get 2 food and 2 water, then i'll get the remaining items.",798,3
mturk_agent_1,"Again, you are being very considerate. I am mostly worried that my hike may take longer or I may get lost. My food rations should be enough but my water inventory worries me....how would you do with 2 food, all the firewood, and allow me to take the 3 waters. It would remove a heavy worry for me if you could help me on this..truly. Is this something you could accept?",798,3
mturk_agent_2,"ok. that's a reasonable offer. i'm still concerned about not getting any of the water, but i will accept your offer.",798,4
mturk_agent_1,"So 3 firewood, 2 food for you and 3 water, 1 food only for me.....correct?",798,4
mturk_agent_2,"yes, correct. this sounds like a great deal for both of us. 🙂",798,5
mturk_agent_1,Thank you and safe hiking. 🙂,798,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,798,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,798,6
mturk_agent_2,"hi can i have all the firewood, food and water",799,0
mturk_agent_1,"You are not getting everything, thats just selfish",799,0
mturk_agent_2,sorry for making you feel so,799,1
mturk_agent_1,"I will need 3x food as I need it for my trip, no food nearby. in return I can let you have all the firewood",799,1
mturk_agent_2,"what of the water, i also need some food, am really in need",799,2
mturk_agent_1,I can give you 1 water,799,2
mturk_agent_2,"and the food, i need one",799,3
mturk_agent_1,in that case then you will only get 2 firewood,799,3
mturk_agent_2,two waters then,799,4
mturk_agent_1,"ok, so I will get 3 food, 1 water and 0 firewood, you will get 0 food, 2 water and 3 firewood",799,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,799,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,799,5
mturk_agent_2,How are you today? Did you have any preferences on the supplies we will be trading?,8,0
mturk_agent_1,I am good. How about yourself? I think I would like some firewood to start off with. We like to have bigger fires. What about you?,8,0
mturk_agent_2,I am good as well. That is good to hear that you like to have bigger fires as we do not care much for that. We would much rather have some extra water.,8,1
mturk_agent_1,"Water is a little important to us too though , if possible maybe we can split that or maybe we can get some more food in replacement.",8,1
mturk_agent_2,That may be possible.... 🙂 What did you have in mind for the food replacement? ,8,2
mturk_agent_1,You can have all the water if we can have all the food?,8,2
mturk_agent_2,I dont think I am okay with that ☹️. Food is essential to our groups morale when camping. We would like 1 additional food preferably.,8,3
mturk_agent_1,Well you guys did say you did not care much about large fires. What if you gave all the firewood in replace for the water and you can still keep 1 food?,8,3
mturk_agent_2,So I would get 3 water and 1 food and youd get 3 firewood and 2 food?,8,4
mturk_agent_1,Yea that seems like an alright trade to me 🙂,8,4
mturk_agent_2,Hmm... alright then 🙂.,8,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,8,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,8,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello! 🙂,80,0
mturk_agent_1,I hello I need firewood to survive,80,0
mturk_agent_2,"oh my are you going somewhere cold? I could use the water, I am going on a charity event with kids from the Make A Wish foundation. Its going to be their first time!",80,1
mturk_agent_1,Ok I will give you 3 waters if you give me 3 firewood,80,1
mturk_agent_2,"sure i can do that, what about the food then? how much food would you need for the tip?  can you hunt where you are going?",80,2
mturk_agent_1,I am up to u ,80,2
mturk_agent_2,ok well since you are and i have a bunch of kids with me would it be fine if I took 2 food as well then?,80,3
mturk_agent_1,Alright that works as long as I get 3 firewoods,80,3
mturk_agent_2,"sounds good, 3 firewood for you and 1 food and 3 water for me and 2 food. sounds like we made a deal!",80,4
mturk_agent_1,alright perfect,80,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,80,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,80,5
mturk_agent_1,Isn't it lovely to go camping? But it's kinda hot out here. I hope that I brought enough water and food.,800,0
mturk_agent_2,It’s very nice here. We will need sufficient water. ,800,0
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, do you have heat sensitivity too? ",800,1
mturk_agent_2,"No, but out here we all will be sensitive to the heat. Especially if we stay here as long as we intended too. ",800,1
mturk_agent_1,How long do you intend to stay out here and camp? Cause I'll be here for a few days.,800,2
mturk_agent_2,That’s good to know. I’ll be here for 5 days.  Perhaps we should ration the water accordingly. ,800,2
mturk_agent_1,I agree. But I would gladly trade some extra firewood for some extra water if think you have enough water.,800,3
mturk_agent_2,I will need the extra firewood to cook meals and keep warm. ,800,3
mturk_agent_1,Then I think we can help each other out then. Cause I don't I need all of my firewood and don't want to haul it with me,800,4
mturk_agent_2,That makes sense.  I can give you a package of water for at least one and half of the firewood. ,800,4
mturk_agent_1,How about an even 2 packages of water for two packages of firewood?,800,5
mturk_agent_2,I don’t think that is fair. Water at this point is more valuable. ,800,5
mturk_agent_1,Do you need any extra food? Cause I can spare a package of food to go with firewood to make things more fair.,800,6
mturk_agent_2,Interesting. I’m a little hesitant to give up my water though. ,800,6
mturk_agent_1,"But I really do need it, I suffer from severe heat sensitivity and can get very sick without enough water.",800,7
mturk_agent_2,I understand. So I will give you two water in exchange for one food and two firewood package. ,800,7
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you! That would be helpful, I can enjoy camping without worrying too much.",800,8
mturk_agent_2,Awesome. Enjoy and be safe. ,800,8

mturk_agent_1,"No, am sorry. Unfortunately, that doesn't work for us. We used up most of our water for the food items without realizing it and now we are almost out of water. ",806,0
mturk_agent_2,Wow sorry to hear that I can do 3 waters which should help you out and I'll take the 3 firewood and 2 food,806,1
mturk_agent_1,Thats kind of you. We can really use the water. Having said that we may need some firewood also as some of the firewood got wet and is unusable. We do not mind if you take 2 firewoods. We can take 1 firewood and 1 food.,806,1
mturk_agent_2,Sorry I need the firewood to boil the river water so I can boil it to get the germs out so I have something to drink,806,2
mturk_agent_1,I understand but we have kids with us and it has gotten particularly cold today. We can take 1 firewood and you can take 2. You can also take all the food if that helps. Am sure you understand how it can get with kids ☹️,806,2
mturk_agent_2,I have  dogs with me so I need to make sure they have fresh water I can do 2 firewood that way you can also boil water and 3 food,806,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay. So we can take 3 waters and 1 firewood. You can take 2 firewoods and 3 food. Does that work?,806,3

mturk_agent_2,what are you top needs? i am a little low on water and firewood but have plenty of extra food.,807,1
mturk_agent_1,"Did you need water the most, then firewood?",807,2
mturk_agent_2,"correct, water my biggest need then firewood. ",807,2
mturk_agent_1,I think we can work out a fair deal. I have the same requirements as you but it's possible to split it evenly.,807,3
mturk_agent_2,sounds good. what about you get 2 water and i get 1 but i also 2 firewood and 2 food to make up the difference. i would be getting 4 items to your 4 but you getting the 2 waters. what do you think?,807,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about you get 3 water and 1 food, I get 3 firewood and 2 food, both will end up even since we have the same needs.",807,4

mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,807,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,807,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello there! I think we both are going after the extra stuff. I was wondering if I could get most/all of the firewood and maybe some of the water because I forgot to buy them. ,808,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well I really need the water because I've been sick(I won't go into details), but I'm a bit dehydrated.",808,0
mturk_agent_1,Im sorry to hear that. That fine you can get the water if you need it. But is it fine that I get 3 firewood then?I really dont have any ,808,1
mturk_agent_2,I need at least 1 firewood. I forgot to bring warm clothes unfortunately. How about I take 3 water 1 wood and all the food?,808,1
mturk_agent_1,That is a little problematic for me because I did not bring enough also☹️. Maybe we can split this up a little more evenly?,808,2
mturk_agent_2,Okay. I have a few hotdogs but I definitely need some chips or something to go with them. Maybe we can split the food up. But as for water I would like 2 at least. I don't think i can survive without it.,808,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good. How about I get 2 firewood and you get 2 waters so we have some for both of us and maybe be let me have 2 foods cause I did not bring any and you already have some?,808,3
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good except I could really use a bit more food. I'm trying to bulk you know? I would hate to waste my hard earned gains.,808,3
mturk_agent_1,"If thats the case I am willing to trade the leftover firewood you have for the one extra food. I mean the weather isn't suppose to be ""that"" cold any ways. ",808,4
mturk_agent_2,Okay you can have 1 water 2 wood and 2 food. I'll just lose my gains I suppose ☹️. Sound good?,808,4

mturk_agent_1,"I hope to spend an afternoon with my family in the camp, however, the amount of food they give us is not enough because we are a large family. So I need more food to feed my family at camp.😮",809,1
mturk_agent_2,"I need some food too, I have lanterns so I can give you a lot of firewood.",809,1
mturk_agent_1,What do you think if in the camp we get together and have a meeting between your family and mine? We can have a small party to get to know each other better.,809,2
mturk_agent_2,"That would be fun, how much water do you need?",809,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I don't need a lot of water because I have a purification system, and with it I have all the water I need. My main objective for the camp is food, since I have a large family and the amount of food they give in the camp is very small for my whole family.",809,3
mturk_agent_2,I would give you 3 wood if I can get 3 water.,809,3
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I like it, I offer you 3 water, 1 food and or Firewood. Before making a deal, I like to talk to people, get to know them better. And if we are going to make a proposal for a party between the two families in the camp, we should get to know each other better.",809,4

mturk_agent_1,I'm excited too! I am an avid fisherman so I can't wait to catch plenty of fish for us to eat.,81,1
mturk_agent_2,Do you need extra firewood to cook the fish? I have a bunch.,81,1
mturk_agent_1,"I do need a little firewood to cook the fish. However, it's so hot outside that I may get dehydrated. ",81,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ah, so you want some extra water too? I have a lot of lemonade mix for the kids so I'll need water for them.",81,2
mturk_agent_1,I tend to get dehydrated quickly so if I don't have enough to drink I won't be able to provide everyone with food.,81,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, we have extra food too. How about I take 2 water, 1 food, and give the res (1 water, 2 food, 3 firewood) to you?",81,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's super thoughtful of you. However, I really need two waters so I can provide for everyone. Once we have enough food and fire we can always go get water from the stream and boil it for the kids.",81,4
mturk_agent_2,"Of course there is no garuntee you will catch anything, if you want 2 waters I'd prefer to take all the food just in case",81,4

mturk_agent_1,"Yes 🙂 Since you are doing hiking, I bet you could use a lot of water...",810,1
mturk_agent_2,"Actually, I'm staying near a lake so water isn't too high of a priority for me. Food's the main one",810,2
mturk_agent_1,Me too. I did not get a chance to grab lunch so I am pretty hungry now. And I eat a lot...,810,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ugh, I wish I could give you some food but I didn't pack as much as I need so I'm a little worried about this hiking trip",810,3
mturk_agent_1,I can do without water but I really need to eat. How about firewood?,810,3
mturk_agent_2,"I only really need one bundle of firewood, you can take the rest.",810,4
mturk_agent_1,But I still need some food... I don't want to starve all through the night...,810,4
mturk_agent_2,"I can give you one bunch of food, I can't go any higher than that though.",810,5
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, you get 2 food and 1 firewood. I can get the rest",810,5
mturk_agent_2,"yes, you can get 2 water too",810,6

mturk_agent_2,Exactly! I'm going to take advantage of the clear skies and get going- we're headed to a high altitude.,811,2
mturk_agent_1,What items are do you need most?,811,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm hoping for wood, then food- there's no brush and little to hunt where we're going. How about you?",811,3
mturk_agent_1,"I too was hoping for wood, less interested in food as we already have a lot. ",811,3
mturk_agent_2,"So your second priority is water, then? ",811,4
mturk_agent_1,yes,811,4
mturk_agent_2,Well that works. I'd gladly give you the water if you'll give me the food. Then we would just need to decide who gets what firewood.,811,5
mturk_agent_1,"How does 1 firewood, 3 food and 1 water sound? Or as an alternative 2 firewood 2 food  and 0 water?",811,5
mturk_agent_2,"I'd take 2 firewood, 2 food, and give you the rest if that's what you're suggesting! I can always melt snow haha",811,6

mturk_agent_2,well that is a nice offer but you should know that i can not release all that for you to take along ,812,2
mturk_agent_1,Why not?,812,2
mturk_agent_2,"if i give you three food, three firewood and two water i will not be left with much to survive on when you are away",812,3
mturk_agent_1,You already have your basic supplies. These are just bonus supplies,812,3
mturk_agent_2,yes i know they are bonus supplies but they are something i need and i can not just give them out because they are bonus supplies,812,4

mturk_agent_2,"I understand, it's hard to prepare for extra people when planning out a camping trip. However, this deal will not work for me. What else do you suggest?",813,1
mturk_agent_1,This is a hard decision.  I could maybe give up one of the food packages in exchange for another water. ,813,1
mturk_agent_2,"So to clarify, you would like 2 food, 3 waters and 1 firewood? ",813,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I would need that with the amount of people that are on my trip. 🙂",813,2
mturk_agent_2,"That would only leave me with 1 food, no water, and 2 firewood.☹️ I need water to keep my kids hydrated, I do not want anyone to get heat exhaustion. Maybe you could as some of the extra people on your trip to go and pick up some extra supplies so that we can make this more fair? ",813,3

mturk_agent_2,I would like to get a higher number of food.  I can give you some wood or water in exchange,814,1

mturk_agent_2,And what would you like in return,814,4

mturk_agent_1,Ya I'd love to! What I really need is food and water because I have ten kids! ,815,0
mturk_agent_2,"Oh wow, that's alot!  I was needing food and water because I'm a large guy and currently dehydrated already.  My doctor says I need at 3000 calories a day just to maintain my weight and desperately need the water to overcome the dehydration.  What do you propose?",815,1
mturk_agent_1,Wow that's a lot! Do you need food or water more?,815,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, since I'm dehydrated, I'd say the water.  Sounds like you need the food more for all those kids.  How about you get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood.  I'm camping in Alaska and it's really cold so could use the firewood.  That way, you get 2 food for your kids.  ",815,2
mturk_agent_1,Can I get 3 food and you get three water and one firewood?,815,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I think I really need at least 1 food or else I'll starve!",815,3
mturk_agent_1,But Water is your most essential item! If not that how about two food one water and two firewood for me?,815,3
mturk_agent_2,But you need the food for all those kids and I need the water for my condition and the wood because it's so cold.  How about 3 food for you and 1 wood and I'll take the 3 water and 2 wood?,815,4

mturk_agent_2,"No problem - our team only asks for what it needs, so you are welcome to all the firewood.",817,4

mturk_agent_2,Same I love camping! 🙂What are your favorite activities when camping?,818,1
mturk_agent_1,I actually like hiking the most!  Would you mind sharing your top priority item with me?  Right now I need water the most since I am coming with a huge family and we forgot iodine pills and can’t purify the river water.,818,1
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, I'm not much of a camper. I mostly go for sing alongs and enjoying sitting around the campfire.",818,2
mturk_agent_1,Sounds like so much fun! I also love sitting around campfires aha.  Would you be okay with me taking 3 packages of water since we'll need it for the hiking we're planning on?  You could take 3 packages of whatever you need the most 🙂,818,2
mturk_agent_2,Mine is water as well but I don't mind giving it away 🙂. How I get 3 firewood and 2 food? You get 3 water and 1 food?,818,3
mturk_agent_1,that works for me actually 🙂 Thank you for being willing to give up your top priority,818,3
mturk_agent_2,"No problem, hiking requires one to be very hydrated",818,4

mturk_agent_1,Hello.,82,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello there, fellow camper!  🙂",82,0
mturk_agent_1,"I would like 3 packages of food, 2 packages of firewood, and 1 package of water.",82,1
mturk_agent_2,"That's not going to work for me at all, I would like 3 packages of water, 2 packages of food, and 1 package of firewood",82,1
mturk_agent_1,"That would leave me with no water. I would like 1 package of water, 2 packages of food, and 2 packages of firewood.",82,2
mturk_agent_2,"You'll have some water, this is for extra.  Would you take 2 packages of food and 3 packages of firewood in exchange for me getting 3 packages of water and 1 package of food?",82,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I would.",82,3
mturk_agent_2,And you can use your extra firewood to purify any water you find as well while you're already enjoying the fire.,82,3
mturk_agent_1,That's true.  Thanks for the suggestion🙂,82,4
mturk_agent_2,"I'm going to be lazy and enjoy the cool night, personally.  I do love this time of year for camping.  The nights are cool but not cold.",82,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, but I tend to get cold easily.",82,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,82,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,82,6
mturk_agent_1,I would like to get 3 of the extra food packets and 1 firewood,820,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello. How are you. That is a lot considering my issue that I have - I need to eat or at least snack something multiple times a day, otherwise I won't be able to function on this trip 😮. I was hoping to get 3 food as well. Not sure if I could do 2.",820,0
mturk_agent_1,"Oh maybe we can work something out, I need the extra food packets as my children will be with me. Even if I dont eat, I need for them to have plenty. Could I get 2 food packets and 2 of the firewood packs?",820,1
mturk_agent_2,I could possible consider 2 firewood packs if I get all 3 food?,820,1
mturk_agent_1,"I cant give up the 3 food packets, my kids will starve. The most I can do is give you 1 food packet, 1 firewood and 2 of the extra waters",820,2
mturk_agent_2,I might not be able to go to the trip then. I understand that we all do get basic packets already. Unfortunately - as I said - I would be not able to function there properly. I understand your concern but I am sorry.☹️,820,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well if we walk away we both suffer, lets try to think about all that is involved. Unfortunately, we cant split the 3rd food packet. I think I should take the 2 food packets since children are involved. How can we split the rest of the items to make it fair.",820,3
mturk_agent_2,I cannot even think further about getting anything. I know I will suffer if I go without these supplies. So for me it would be not good one way or the other. Plus Firewood is another crucial thing because I get so cold and would need to constantly keep warm. So these two things both are crucial.,820,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about this I will share 1 food packet with my kids. I would need 2 firewood packs, and the 3 extra waters. That way you can have the 2 food packets 🙂",820,4
mturk_agent_2,"In that case you are getting way more supplies. This is why I was already saying earlier - one way or the other I would suffer because Firewood is also so important. And if I am not getting more food - that is also not good, because water can help with food cravings. ☹️",820,4
mturk_agent_1,"That deal would give you 2 food packets, and 1 extra firewood. That is a fair trade-off",820,5
mturk_agent_2,"3 - 6? I don't consider that fair, I am sorry.",820,5
mturk_agent_1,"so you get 2 food packets, 1 firewood, and 1 water. It is very fair food is mych more valuable then the other items and was your deciding factoe to go or not to go, you will have more food than myself and 3 kids. It is very fair.",820,6
mturk_agent_2,I might be able to be ok with that - as I said - water could help deal with extra food cravings. 😮,820,6
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, we would have less food but a little extra water to help with that. can we agree on me getting 1 food packet, 2 firewood packets, and 2 waters?",820,7
mturk_agent_2,ok.,820,7
mturk_agent_1,"That means you get 2 food, 1 firewood, and 1 water, correct?",820,8
mturk_agent_2,ok,820,8
mturk_agent_1,ALright I hope we both have a fun trip!!!🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂,820,9
mturk_agent_2,"I hope so, as well. Enjoy. I am sorry, I am just worried for my conditions... ☹️ Thank You.",820,9

mturk_agent_2,Me too! What are you most excited about?,821,0
mturk_agent_1,Cooking over the fire. How about you? ,821,1
mturk_agent_2,"I also like a fire, but maybe as a more social activity as well.",821,1
mturk_agent_1,I could see that. So you like to have fun with friends? ,821,2
mturk_agent_2,"I do, and I think that the firewood would help me do that. But I can also see that you'd like to have some.",821,2
mturk_agent_1, 🙂 I was hoping for some extra food because I am horrible at cooking- worried I might burn some.,821,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I'm a little less worried about the food myself - I think that there's going to be enough in the basic supplies.",821,3
mturk_agent_1,How do you feel about the water? I'm not to concerned about it.,821,4
mturk_agent_2,I'd like to have some to make sure that I can do washing without worrying about a drinking supply.,821,4
mturk_agent_1,"I would be ok with one water, two food and two firewood.",821,5
mturk_agent_2,Could I trade a firewood for food - so you get three food & one firewood?,821,5
mturk_agent_1,Sure. That would sound good and we each get a water.,821,6
mturk_agent_2,"I think that's a good deal, so I'll go ahead and submit it.",821,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,821,7

mturk_agent_1,"Also, I want firewood. Because the same things for me also I live in very cold place.",822,1
mturk_agent_2,"We could divide the amount of firewood 50/50, what do you think?",822,1
mturk_agent_1,"I am OK, but how to divide the firewood?",822,2
mturk_agent_2,The amount of firewood that I need is especially to create heat for my grandmother who suffers from arthritis. She is suffering a lot from the cold.,822,2
mturk_agent_1,I give you one amount of firewood. What do you thing?,822,3
mturk_agent_2,"Thank you very much. What do you want for the amount of firewood you offer me, water or food?",822,3
mturk_agent_1,I want food for me. How many food do you give me?,822,4
mturk_agent_2,I can give you all the food you need. Actually my main objective is firewood for my grandmother.,822,4

mturk_agent_2,You can have all the water since it just rained today. But I'm afraid I cannot get any firewood or food in the mountain. ,823,2
mturk_agent_1,"that would be great, i really only one one of either. up to you which one you want to give me.",823,2
mturk_agent_2,So can I have 3 firewood and 2 food,823,3

mturk_agent_1,I'm in need of those too. What would you use the extra firewood for?,824,1
mturk_agent_2,where I am going it rained so no luck to find wood for fire up there and it is supposed to be colder then expected.,824,2
mturk_agent_1,"Oh yeah, I understand that. However, I am also in need of extra firewood and would need it for cooking purposes. How about I take 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water? ",824,2
mturk_agent_2,thats a bit rough i offer 1 firewood 1 food and 2 water for you then we both have something.,824,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think we're getting closer to an agreement🙂 How about 1 firewood, 2 food, and one water?",824,3

mturk_agent_2,Hello I would like to take 2 firewood packages 2 food packages and 2 water packages. I am camping in the desert with 30 + kids on a school trip and we had a few more children come on the trip last min and need to make sure they are warm fed and hydrated.,825,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm sorry, I couldn't possibly give you the majority of everything. I have a large group myself, including a baby that I need to keep warm. I need to have 2 of the firewood, and I can give you two of either the food or the water, but not two of both.",825,0
mturk_agent_2,how old is your baby ?,825,1
mturk_agent_1,she's 6 months old. so i really need to keep her warm.,825,1
mturk_agent_2,ok well given that the 6 month old babies main nutrients comes from breastmilk or formula and you have to hold the baby to feed them plus you should have blanket for the baby which will keep the baby warm. I will consider taking 1 firewood and 2 foods and 1 water. ,825,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think that should be OK. So I get 2 firewood, one food, and 2 water.",825,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes i can agree to that! 🙂 I sure do miss having a 6 month old baby to snuggle lol. mine is 2 and is not interested in snuggling anymore.,825,3
mturk_agent_1,"it is definitely a wonderful time!! Thank you for the firewood, so that I can keep her warm.",825,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes and thank you for the food to keep these children feed and happy they will definitely appreciate it and i will definitely appreciate not having hungry irritable children for the week.. ,825,4

mturk_agent_1,Water too,826,1
mturk_agent_2,"OK, what is the item that is the next most important to you?",826,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I need food for energy. So that is the next most important thing for me. ",826,2
mturk_agent_2,"OK, how about you take 2 water and 1 food and I firewood?",826,3
mturk_agent_1,"Could I have 2 water and 2 food instead? There are 9 items. Obviously, one person will get 4 and the other 5. If I am getting 4, I would prefer 2 food items. ",826,3
mturk_agent_2,"I really will need 2 of either the water or the food, you can decide if you would like.",826,4
mturk_agent_1,"Then can I get 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood?",826,4
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, that sounds good!",826,5

mturk_agent_2,"Well hello there, fellow camper.  I'm not sure I'd like to go without firewood.  Would you accept two firewood and two food?",827,0
mturk_agent_1,"Let me think about that, fellow traveller. What's your highest priority to make this a great trip for you? :-)",827,1
mturk_agent_2,"Honestly, with as warm as it is I'm a big fan of extra water.  🙂",827,1
mturk_agent_1,Ha! You got that right!How about taking two waters for me having the two firewoo and two food?,827,2
mturk_agent_2,"What's your medium preference look like, assuming firewood is most important to you.  Would you take two firewood and all three food?",827,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good. I'll give you all 3 waters for two firewood and sll three foods,827,3
mturk_agent_2,I can definitely live with that.  I think it balances out our wants pretty nicely.,827,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think so, too. So I give you all 3 water and  one firewood, you give me all 3 food and 2 firewood. Correct?",827,4
mturk_agent_2,"Absolutely, and I hope you have a warm sleeping bag as well.  I'll be enjoy the cool night breeze.",827,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,827,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,827,5
mturk_agent_1,"I feel like I can make due without a lot of extra water, but I'm a little concerned about my ability to get food in an emergency.",828,0
mturk_agent_2,I brought a pretty good amount of food due to my diabetes so I'm good in that area. I only need a little extra.,828,0
mturk_agent_1,What are you most desirous of? 🙂,828,1
mturk_agent_2,"I have enough food to make sure I counteract low blood sugar but water is essential to me because I get dehydrated a lot, and I didn't bring enough water.",828,1
mturk_agent_1,"I feel like firewood is helpful with everything.  Keeps you warm, can cook food, and can be used to sterilize water as well.",828,2
mturk_agent_2,True I feel the same. The thing is I'm anemic and get cold easily so I'd prefer 2 of the firewoods.,828,2
mturk_agent_1,I think if I were going to give up 2 of the firewoods I'd want to get all three of the food.,828,3
mturk_agent_2,I don't know if I can give you all the extra food. I can negotiate and let you have two of the firewoods. because I did bring an extra blanket.,828,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well, food is definitely my biggest concern.  How much of the water did you want?  That's the least of my concerns because I feel like water can be found most readily.",828,4
mturk_agent_2,I would like two of the waters because I can only drink purified water. So firewood is your next biggest concern?,828,4
mturk_agent_1,"No, food is my bigger concern.  If your biggest concern is water, what about me getting all the food and you getting all the water?",828,5
mturk_agent_2,Food isn't my biggest concern but it is still a concern. I suffer from low blood sugar so it's essential for me to eat a certain amount of healthy foods. i can give you 2 of the food packages but I'd like to keep one for myself. I'd like two of the waters and only one of the firewoods. :-),828,5
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds reasonable.  That gives each of us some of everything, which I think makes sense.   Why don't you propose that and I'll agree to it.",828,6

mturk_agent_2,Yes!  This camping trip is going to be great!  I hope to make it very memorable.,83,1
mturk_agent_1,"indeed.  anyways, I would like to divide the extra supplies equitably",83,2
mturk_agent_2,I think we can defintiely work together and come up with a great solution and both get what we need,83,2
mturk_agent_1,do you have a particular item preference?,83,3
mturk_agent_2,I do.  I have been looking everything over and feel this won't be to hard to come to an agreement,83,3
mturk_agent_1,"Well my camp places a premium on water.  How would you feel about for me: 2 water, 1 food, 1 firewood?",83,4
mturk_agent_2,I think we're on the right track.  I am bring my 2 kids with me and they eat everything in sight.,83,4
mturk_agent_1,Would they be okay with 2 food?  Otherwise can give you an extra and I can take either an additional water or firewood 🙂,83,5
mturk_agent_2,"I have a great offer.  How about I take 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water and you will get the extra water your camp needs!!",83,5
mturk_agent_1,"We place a premium on the water.  That's the same amount of water, do you mean we take 3?",83,6
mturk_agent_2,"I do need some extra water.  So I will need to take 1, but our preference is food and we would need firewood to cook it on.  if you're OK with this, I will submit it.  Its a great deal I think and we'll both get what we need",83,6
mturk_agent_1,"my counter then is 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood for us and we are set 🙂",83,7
mturk_agent_2,"We're really going to need that extra firewood.  We'll need the heat source, but also for cooking.  It a big deal that I get the extra wood, I hope you will understand why I need it.",83,7
mturk_agent_1,my people feel like they need 1 extra of something or else they will throw a fit ☹️,83,8
mturk_agent_2,No fits!!  They're getting that extra water they really want.  I am sure they'll be OK with giving a group with kids a little extra firewood to make this camping trip awesome for them,83,8
mturk_agent_1,Okay if they get 3 water they are good with that allotment for the others,83,9
mturk_agent_2,"I think taking 1 extra water, for safety purposes will be OK for us and your group will get that.  I am going to submit a GREAT offer that is mutually beneficial.  ",83,9
mturk_agent_1,okie dokie 🙂,83,10
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,83,10
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,83,11
mturk_agent_2,Hey friend. I need more food because the activities my group has chosen require a lot of energy hence a lot of food.,830,0
mturk_agent_1,Hey friend. I would be willing to give you food for you activities in exchange for the water. I'm camping in a desert and there's no water sources out here.,830,0
mturk_agent_2,That is fine. So I take all the food you take all the water. Is that fine?,830,1
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds good to me, and then we can split the firewood amongst us. ",830,1
mturk_agent_2,Yea. You are a good partner. Can I take 2 firewood I give you one,830,2
mturk_agent_1,I'd personally like 2 firewood because I don't have any extra food and will need to cook what I find. Firewood can help me cook and keep warm at night. What do you think?,830,2
mturk_agent_2,It is also very cold here and I have a condition triggered by cold weather. But we need to compromise.,830,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hm. If I give you two firewood can I then have one of the food? That way you can keep warm, and I'll have some food to compensate for less firewood to keep warm and cook with. ",830,3
mturk_agent_2,No. Let me give you two firewood. I need as much food as I can find.,830,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, that sounds fair to me! I understand you need food for your group! 🙂",830,4

mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I was thinking I could take two water, two food, and one firewood.",831,1
mturk_agent_2,What is more important to you food or water? and why,831,1
mturk_agent_1,"Water, because I need to drink more than I eat.",831,2
mturk_agent_2,"I am a bit on the older side, I do not eat much food, water is important to me as well",831,2
mturk_agent_1,"I see, and how important is the firewood to you?",831,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well being on the older side, it may be difficult for me to chop and collect firewood, it is most important to me",831,3
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, do you have an offer you want to make to me?",831,4
mturk_agent_2,I could take all 3 firewood if you perhaps want all the food?,831,4
mturk_agent_1,"I need water most, so how about I take 2 water, all the food, and let you have all the firewood?",831,5
mturk_agent_2,Can you throw in 1 food for me?,831,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,831,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,831,6
mturk_agent_2,"hi friend i am seethal , how are you friend",832,0
mturk_agent_1,I am good. How are you today.\?,832,0
mturk_agent_2,"me also good dear friend, how is yours, ",832,1
mturk_agent_1,Doing great can,832,1
mturk_agent_2,"yes bro can we start the deal , lets go for the deal, please dont end the negotiation we both are  lost then f we fix the deal both can get benifit ",832,2
mturk_agent_1,"Good shot there Man. Look, I am in need of firewood the most, and water too. If you give me 3 firewood and 2 water, I will give you 3 food. What do you think?",832,2
mturk_agent_2,"bro  my priority also same, please give 3 firewood, i will give you 3 water , ",832,3
mturk_agent_1,And 3 ffod?,832,3
mturk_agent_2,give 2 food,832,4
mturk_agent_1,"Give 1 package of firewood, 2 packages of water and 1 package of food. Seal this deal Sir.",832,4
mturk_agent_2,"bro then we can make 2 firewood and 3 food u can take 3 water and one firewood, then benifit will both equal",832,5
mturk_agent_1,We have a deal.,832,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,832,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,832,6
mturk_agent_2,Hi ,833,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi.  How are you today. ,833,0
mturk_agent_2,good thanks,833,1
mturk_agent_1,Me Too.  How about I get 2 water and 2 food and 1 firewood?  You can have the rest.,833,1
mturk_agent_2,I was thinking the same for myself. I am really sensitive to the heat so water is essential for me so that I don't pass out,833,2
mturk_agent_1,"I understand that completely, but I have kidney disease so I need the extra water for my kidneys to function properly.",833,2
mturk_agent_2,I think we need to assign more value to the water so we can get an even value. Whoever gets the two waters should get one food and one firewood. that seems only fair,833,3
mturk_agent_1,I agree that the water has higher value.  I'll take 2 waters and the one food and one firewood.  Do you agree with that since I have the medical condition?,833,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'll give you an option to consider. You can use the firewood to boil water at the campsite to make it useable. So either option works for me. To be clear we are deciding between option A 2 water, 1 food and 1 firewood and option b 1 water 2 food and 2 firewood. I am ok with either",833,4
mturk_agent_1,"I really need the extra water, so I'll take option A.  🙂",833,4
mturk_agent_2,ok I'll take B and we have a deal,833,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,833,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,833,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi,834,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi 🙂,834,0
mturk_agent_1,How are you?,834,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm good. How are you?,834,1
mturk_agent_1,Im great too.,834,2
mturk_agent_2,"I would like to take two of the food packages, one of the water and one of the firewood. ",834,2
mturk_agent_1,I see that you do but there could be more negotiaitons,834,3
mturk_agent_2,What is your preference?,834,3
mturk_agent_1,Three for food,834,4
mturk_agent_2,I understand that you need that but I think we could compromise as I'm sure we both need food to make our camping trip easier.,834,4
mturk_agent_1,Thats true I agree with you on that we can do what you said earlier,834,5
mturk_agent_2,That works. Thanks for negotiating with me. ,834,5
mturk_agent_1,Your welcome I agree to the negotiation.,834,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,834,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,834,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, are you excited about going camping?",835,0
mturk_agent_2,I am so excited. How about you?,835,0
mturk_agent_1,Yeah! We have a big group coming with us so and we're going camping so it should be very fun. ,835,1
mturk_agent_2,Are you worried about running out of supplies at all? I'm a little worried about having enough firewood.,835,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm worried a lot about having enough water to give everyone after the hiking and also a little bit about feeding everyone. ,835,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, you can have all the water and one food if you'd like. I'm not too worried about water since there's a spring where I'm going.",835,2
mturk_agent_1,That would be great! You can have the firewood. ,835,3
mturk_agent_2,Sounds like a deal thanks!,835,3
mturk_agent_1,You're welcome. When do you leave for your trip?,835,4
mturk_agent_2,This weekend! I can't wait.🙂,835,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,835,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,835,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello how are you?🙂,836,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am good, how are you? 🙂",836,0
mturk_agent_1,Good thank you. I would like to tell you i have a medical condition that makes me need a much larger amount of water to stay hydrated and healthy. This leaves my body temperature at a colder state. I will ask that you please take this into consideration,836,1
mturk_agent_2,I will absolutely take that into consideration. We are quite a bit of people on this trip so could you take into consideration that we need a lot of food? ,836,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes we do not need any extra,836,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds great! ,836,2
mturk_agent_1,How about 3 waters 2 woods 0 foods for me?,836,3
mturk_agent_2,I think that is a pretty fair deal,836,3
mturk_agent_1,Well its been great neogotiating with you🙂 Lets see if we spoke enough,836,4
mturk_agent_2,You too! And hopefully 🙂,836,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,836,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,836,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi - I'm so excited for our camping trip.  I'm most excited about getting to eat food that I normally don't when I am home.,837,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello! camper, how are you? I need us to make a deal where we all benefit.",837,0
mturk_agent_2,"I agree - I really love food.  If I don't get it, I get hangry 🙂.  If you're ok with me getting all the food, I think I can make it with just one firewood and one water.",837,1
mturk_agent_1,What do you think if in the camp we get together and hold a meeting between your family and mine. We can have a small party so that we get to know each other better.,837,1
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like an excellent idea.  I love meeting and getting to know others.,837,2
mturk_agent_1,"My main objective for the camp is also food, since I have a large family and the amount of food they give in the camp is very small for my whole family.",837,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can do without one of the food, so maybe I can get 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water?",837,3
mturk_agent_1,"I do not like the deal very much, but for that we must talk and decide as adults a good deal for both of us. What we want is to enjoy in the camp.",837,3
mturk_agent_2,"Agreed - I enjoy camping.  A big part of that for me is that I get to eat food.  If I don't eat, I don't enjoy it so camping is basically a buffet for me.  I am pretty dead set on having at least two packages of food.  I can negotiate the water and firewood.",837,4
mturk_agent_1,How many members are there in your family group? To make a proposal taking into account the food you need according to your family group.,837,4
mturk_agent_2,"I have me, my wife, and my four kids.  They are all teenagers.  You know how they go through food 🙂.",837,5
mturk_agent_1,"Before making a deal I like to talk to people, to get to know them better. And if we are going to make a proposal for a party between the two families in the camp, it is in our best interest to know each other better.",837,5
mturk_agent_2,"Understood, but I don't know anything about you.  I've offered a lot of information about me.  This is a two-way street. 🙂  ",837,6
mturk_agent_1,"My family is made up of my wife, my five children and me. All my children are minors, but they eat too much. When they don't eat they get very restless.🙂",837,6
mturk_agent_2,"I think one teenage kid is equivalent to young children.  The least I'm willing to accept is 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water.  I don't see another option as you haven't provided me any.  Let me know so we can get on our own camping trips.",837,7
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, my proposal is to give you everything you need for food, because you have given me good reasons, on the condition that you give me everything I need for water and firewood. Because I can take some food to cook in the camp and I need a lot of firewood and water.",837,7
mturk_agent_2,What is your proposal.  Everything meaning you get 3 firewood and 3 water is not going to work for me.  Let me know.,837,8
mturk_agent_1,"My proposal is to give you 2 foods, 1 water and 1 wood. I need water and firewood to cook in the camp. Unless you want 2 for water, 2 for reading, and 1 for food?",837,8
mturk_agent_2,No thanks - I don't think we're going to come to a deal.  I hope you enjoy your camping trip.,837,9
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,837,9
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,837,10
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,837,10
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,837,11
mturk_agent_1,"I can offer you this other treatment: 3 Food, 0 Firewood and 1 Water. I'm giving you all the food. What does it say?",837,11
mturk_agent_2,"I'm going to go ahead and walk away from this deal.  I think it's not going to work for us so I wish you, your spouse, and five children a ton of fun on your camping trip.",837,12
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,837,12
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,837,13
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I am wondering what your preferences are as to how much water, food, and firewood you would like? ",838,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, I like fire, so my number one preference is firewood. 🙂",838,0
mturk_agent_2,I also like fire 🙂. Do you have any need for food? ,838,1
mturk_agent_1,I am not that interested in food. I don't really have any desire for it. Do have a preference for food?,838,1
mturk_agent_2,"I do need food, it is important to me. ",838,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, would you say you like food or fire more?",838,2
mturk_agent_2,"I like fire more, it is very important to me and then food is next in line. What do you think about water? ",838,3
mturk_agent_1,"I like water. It is good, but not as good as fire. I think I am starting to understand where we are.  :)🙂🙂",838,3
mturk_agent_2,I like to have fire more than food and then water. Fire is the most important to me because I like to keep a fire burning all night long. I get scared of the dark :o :o and the fire makes it so that I am happy :) and content. ,838,4
mturk_agent_1,"That is very reasonable. What about if you have some of all three? You could have 3 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood.",838,4
mturk_agent_2,"I like having 3 of the food. However, I feel that having 2 firewood would be better for keeping my fire burning all night long 🙂 ",838,5
mturk_agent_1,"I could see that maybe you take all the food and I take all the water. How does that sound? Then the only thing we have to discuss is the firewood, right?",838,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,838,6
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,838,6
mturk_agent_1,I have an idea. Do you have a coin? You flip the coin and if I guess correctly I get the 2 firewood. If I don't then you get the 2 firewood?,838,7
mturk_agent_2,Sure that works for me. I have flipped the coin. 🙂 ,838,7
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I guess tails 🙂",838,8
mturk_agent_2,you are correct. You can have the two firewood. ,838,8
mturk_agent_1,Thank you. 🙂,838,9
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,838,9
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,838,10
mturk_agent_2,i need food because i am hungry and due to this spread of coronavirus i fired in my company ,839,0
mturk_agent_1,"That sucks, I am sorry to hear that. I am not good at hunting or fishing though, so I would like a little extra food too",839,0
mturk_agent_2,yes please give what you have or what you wish to give .i does not have enough money to get even little food,839,1
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, how about you get 2 food 1 water and 1 firewood. And I get 1 food 2 water and 2 firewood?",839,1
mturk_agent_2,yeah its a great deal,839,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, sounds good!",839,2
mturk_agent_2,ok thankyou,839,3
mturk_agent_1,"You're welcome, I hope you find another job.",839,3
mturk_agent_2,thank you for your wishes,839,4
mturk_agent_1,"No problem, so I will get 1 food 2 water and 2 firewood",839,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,839,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,839,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I will start out by saying that I would like to have 3 water because I do not have a nearby water source. What is your situation?",84,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello. I have a health issue that I need to stay hydrated at all times. I do understand your situation though. ,84,0
mturk_agent_2,How much firewood and food do you think you need? ,84,1
mturk_agent_1,Im a vegitarian so food I would like 1 food and for fire 2,84,1
mturk_agent_2,"I think that we can work it out 🙂. We could do something like 2 firewood for you, 1 for me. 2 water for me, 1 for you. And 1 or 2 foods for you, 1 or 2 foods for me. What do you think?",84,2
mturk_agent_1,"That is a kind offer. 🙂 The water is very vital for me. How bout 3 water for me, 0 food for me 3 for you and 1 firewood for me and 2 for you ",84,2
mturk_agent_2,Zero water is not going to work 😮. I am willing to switch water and firewood amounts so that I get 2 firewood and 1 water and you get 2 water and 1 firewood. ,84,3
mturk_agent_1,"Alright. But than I will need at least 1 food than. So it would be 2 water for me 1 for you, 1 food for me 2 for you and 1 firewood for me and 2 for you. 🙂",84,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think that sounds ok, I will make that deal with you whenever we can go through with it. 🙂",84,4
mturk_agent_1,Smashing🙂 Sounds good with me. Happy to get it all sorted out. cheers,84,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,84,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,84,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello. I have a large family going camping - there's 17 of us! How big is your group?,840,0
mturk_agent_2,Wow that is a large group.  I assume that is more than just your immediate family.  I will be bringing my husband and five children.  ,840,0
mturk_agent_1,"I see! We don't have a great need for firewood. Water isn't a big deal, either. We're going to need quite a bit of food.",840,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, sure sounds like it!  I will gladly let you have 2 extra packages of food and only take one for myself.  How would you feel about that?",840,1
mturk_agent_1,"We might make that work. If I gave you all the firewood, could you let us have 2 of the food packages and 2 waters? Hopefully that's fair for you, your hubby, and the 5 kids.",840,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good to me.  Do you go camping frequently?  ,840,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, we try to get out with nature at least monthly! Been harder lately with the pandemic and all.",840,3
mturk_agent_2,I hear you.  We like to go camping a lot too but my youngest is only 15 months old so it has been harder this past year.,840,3
mturk_agent_1,I see. So let's recap what we talked about a bit. I'll send you 3 firewood packages. I also send 1 food and 1 water. The rest will be for our big fam!,840,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, great, thank you!",840,4
mturk_agent_1,"OK, sounds good. I'll arrange the amounts now if that's okay with your bunch.",840,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,840,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,840,6
mturk_agent_2,hello,841,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I was wondering where you were.  I need firewood, you can have two of everything else.",841,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm planning my camping trip now.  It's looking like I'm going to need some food.  ,841,1
mturk_agent_1,"How about this, I'll give you three food and one water?  I really need the firewood for cooking.",841,1
mturk_agent_2,How about we trade three firewood for 3 food?  that way we both get what we need the most,841,2
mturk_agent_1,"That's good, but we still need to split the water.  I'll need water, because I'm fishing anf it gets hot.",841,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok so we have a deal on the 3 for 3 firewood for food?  Where are you going to be fishing at?,841,3
mturk_agent_1,"Lake tenkiller, some nice bass there.  Are you going into the hills?",841,3
mturk_agent_2,I'm heading for the mountains.  I can use one package of water for the hike up and back.  YOu could take the other two packages to quench your thirst while reeling in some monster bass!,841,4
mturk_agent_1,"Cool.  I'll take three firewood and two water, you get three food and one water.  Do we have a deal?",841,4
mturk_agent_2,Sounds like we have a deal to make the most out of our camping trips!  Do I submit it?,841,5
mturk_agent_1,Wait while I do it'll prompti you when you answer questions.,841,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,841,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,841,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I would like 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water.",842,0
mturk_agent_1,Tell me about your decision a little more,842,0
mturk_agent_2,I have a larger appetite than some people so I would like a little more food and I get cold very easily so I need more firewood.,842,1
mturk_agent_1,So those items are more important to you?,842,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, they are. Do you have any preferences?",842,2
mturk_agent_1,Yeah I need water more than anything. If you offered another water I would give you an extra food,842,2
mturk_agent_2,So how about I get 3 food and 2 firewood?,842,3
mturk_agent_1,Yeah that sounds good to me. Are you satisfied with that?,842,3
mturk_agent_2,I am satisfied. Should we submit the deal?,842,4
mturk_agent_1,"Let's do it, go ahead and send it to me",842,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,842,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,842,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello 🙂 For my trip, we will need 3 firewood to burn a large bonfire. Would you like to give us all your supplies and join our party?",843,0
mturk_agent_2,"As long as I would be able to join your party, that sounds like a great deal. We can all be warm.",843,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes! 🙂 You are welcome here. All of your friends are also welcome here. 🙂 We will all be warm together.,843,1
mturk_agent_2,You can have all three wood.,843,1
mturk_agent_1,Thank you. We may also have all three food the merrier?,843,2
mturk_agent_2,"I don't think that is fair. I will take two of the food, and we can always share or trade later. ",843,2
mturk_agent_1,I am somewhat bewildered by your sudden move. 😮 Aren't you joining our party?,843,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, but I would like to keep some of the food on my person in case something happens.",843,3
mturk_agent_1,I hope there's some way that you and I could see eye to eye without conflict. Would you like to bring someone arbitrary to quartermaster our food?,843,4
mturk_agent_2,"if you have three wood already, i need some of the extra supplies.",843,4
mturk_agent_1,"Would you like to hold all three water, while I hold all 3 firewood and an arbitrary cook in our party holds 3 food?? ",843,5
mturk_agent_2,I can agree to that deal,843,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,843,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,843,6
mturk_agent_1,"I need firewood and water more, if you want more of the food?",844,0
mturk_agent_2,I need food but I also need water. Why do you need the water?,844,0
mturk_agent_1,"We are planning a family hike,which would require more water rather than food.",844,1
mturk_agent_2,We are also planning a hike. But I could get by with 1 water if you would let us have 1 firewood?,844,1
mturk_agent_1,Awesome! I can do that! You can definitely have 1 firewood if you will let me have 2 waters.,844,2
mturk_agent_2,"So to confirm, I would get 3 food/1 water/1 firewood and you would get 2 firewood and 2 waters?",844,2
mturk_agent_1,"If I can have 1 food, 1 firewood, and 2 waters, would you be willing to take 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water?🙂",844,3
mturk_agent_2,I'll take that as a deal! ,844,3
mturk_agent_1,"Great, thank you! My kids will thank you for the supplies! 🙂",844,4
mturk_agent_2,"No problem! If you can submit the deal, then we're all set to go.",844,4

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,844,5
mturk_agent_2,"We are a family of 8 among of which I have 5 juniors at a growing age with high food consumption. Thus, the need to exchange have we have, water, for the much needed food.",845,0
mturk_agent_1,Oh i am sorry to say we have a large family as well with growing children and a breastfeeding mom. We will have to work out the food situation. ,845,0
mturk_agent_2,How about I include some firewood? Remember you have the basic food in your arsenal. I would just like to exchange for the extra you have.,845,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes i know, as you should take that into consideration as well. You said you dont need water so lets agree on me having 3 and you can have all the firewood. ",845,1
mturk_agent_2,Not even to spare a package of food? ☹️,845,2
mturk_agent_1,"No i think i can take 2 food, 3 water, 0 firewood. ",845,2
mturk_agent_2,Food is my most essential as well. A package is not enough for us,845,3
mturk_agent_1,"As i said we are a family of the same size. I can give you 2 but thats it, in exchange i would like 2 fire wood as we will need to hunt. So you get 2 food, 0 water, 1 firewood",845,3
mturk_agent_2,"Lets make it 2 food, 1 water, 1 firewood",845,4
mturk_agent_1,Sure that sounds fair,845,4
mturk_agent_2,ok,845,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,845,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,845,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello there!,846,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello!,846,0
mturk_agent_2,"I'm looking forward to the camping trip, but need to sure up some of the remaining supplies. Hopefully we can divide them up fairly!",846,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm sure we can make a deal. I know I need firewood and food, water is less of a priority. ",846,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ah firewood and water and bigger priorities for me (firewood especially), but food is not a concern for me",846,2
mturk_agent_1,Firewood is especially a priority for me. I'd be willing to sacrifice some water in exchange for more firewood packages. ,846,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ideally, I'd like to get my hands on as much firewood as possible. My son has a blood disease which makes it difficult for him to stay warm at night ☹️",846,3
mturk_agent_1,"I would as well. I'm camping in an area with no brush/trees, I need to make sure I have enough to stay alive during the night. If you bring less firewood do you think you could find some where you're camping?",846,3
mturk_agent_2,"I doubt it. We're camping primarily in a tundra with little burnable vegetation. Perhaps we can come to an agreement were you receive more supplies in total, and I take a little more firewood?",846,4
mturk_agent_1,"I would be up for that as long as I can get at least get 1 firewood package. My next priority would be food, would you be willing to give me all the packages of food and I'll give you the water?",846,4
mturk_agent_2,"I think that sounds very fair. I'll take 2 firewood (thank you!), and you take 1 firewood. You take all 3 food and I'll take all 3 water.",846,5
mturk_agent_1,"Whoops, I didn't realize. I'd still like to have 1 water just in case, and because you'll have more of the firewood which was both of our priority. Do you think that would still be fair?",846,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,846,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,846,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there. I can give you 2 waters, but can I have 3 firewood and 3 food? We have a big group and are really going to need these supplies. ",847,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey. I definitely agree to the 2 waters! However, the other terms won't really work for me. My friend and I tend to get low blood sugar and while we have other supplies, we would like to have some extra food, so would like at least 1 food from the extra supplies. Also, how about 1 firewood? Would that still leave your group with enough?",847,0
mturk_agent_2,We have a really big group of folks who are really fat so we can't part with the food. ,847,1
mturk_agent_1,"I totally understand where you're coming from. My group is a little smaller, so I think I would be okay with your group taking all 3 food.",847,1
mturk_agent_2,Oh that would be very kind of you. Would you be ok with taking 1 firewood possibly? ,847,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah I would be fine with that. I mainly want it so we can have extra to keep away bugs and other animals mainly at night. So, 1 firewood would work for us.",847,2
mturk_agent_2,Oh you are a very kind negotiator. ,847,3
mturk_agent_1,Thanks! 🙂 You're also being really understanding. Are you still okay with my group taking 2 water?,847,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes that is fine with me. Shall we make a deal?,847,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds good to me!,847,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,847,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,847,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello. Are you ready to play let's make a deal? ,848,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, yes I am.  What do you want?",848,0
mturk_agent_2,Firewood is my highest priority item. ,848,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's cool, I won't need much.  Water is my main priority.",848,1
mturk_agent_2,Okay. What if I give you two packages of water? ,848,2
mturk_agent_1,"I really need all three, since I do a lot of hiking.  I was thinking I get all the water, I'll give you 2 of the firewood and two of the food.",848,2
mturk_agent_2,I need water too. ,848,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hmmm, okay.  How bout you get one water, two firewood, and one food?",848,3
mturk_agent_2,"If we do that then you will get five packages of items, while I only have 4. That's not fair. How about I get 2 firewood, 1 water and 2 food. ",848,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds fair to me.  Do we have a deal?,848,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes,848,5

mturk_agent_2,🙂,849,0
mturk_agent_1,🙂 hi how are you? ,849,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am good, and you?",849,1
mturk_agent_1,I am good.  I'm going camping this weekend.  I need a lot of extra firewood because I'm having a big bonfire.  What kind of supplies do you most need?,849,1
mturk_agent_2,"We are going as a large  group, so food is what we need most. But we are also going to need lots of wood, since it may get cold.",849,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, are you guys going to need extra water?  We will definitely need some extra, in case we have dishes. ",849,2
mturk_agent_2,We wont need much extra water. We plan to drink mainly alcohol. ,849,3
mturk_agent_1,I'd like 2 packages of fire wood and 3 packages of water.  Then you would get 1 pack of wood and 3 packages of food.  What to you think,849,3
mturk_agent_2,"I would like 3 packages of food, 1  packages of wood and 1 package of water",849,4
mturk_agent_1,"I really need at least 2 packages of wood.  My bon fire will be huge. 😮 How would you feel if I took two packages of wood and then two packs of water.  That would leave you with 3 food, 1 water, and 1 wood",849,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,849,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,849,5
mturk_agent_1,The weather is going to be really hot. Could I have 2 water in exchange for you receiving 2 food and 2 firewood?,85,0
mturk_agent_2,I have a low immune system and need to stay warm how about I get all 3 firewood in exchange for the 2 water. ,85,0
mturk_agent_1,I will agree to 3 firewood for 2 water. Maybe I should extra food though so 2 food for me🙂,85,1
mturk_agent_2,I can agree to 2 food. You get 2 and I will get 1 food. That sounds fair to me. 🙂,85,1
mturk_agent_1,"Great, this is going to be a fun trip. So I get 2 water, 2 food and you get 1 water, 1 food and 3 firewood?",85,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I cant wait to set off. It sounds like you have it all correct. I hope we both have a great trip. ",85,2
mturk_agent_1,"I hope it doesn't get cold out since I won't have any firewood. You need it more than I do though, so you should have it all.",85,3
mturk_agent_2,Thank you. I hope I don't run out of water. I get dehydrated easily but I want us both to be comfortable. ,85,3
mturk_agent_1,I really appreciate you helping me out and i hope you have some help carrying all of that firewood.,85,4
mturk_agent_2,I appreciate your help as well. Enjoy your extra food and water on your trip. I hope you can stay warm.,85,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,85,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,85,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello,850,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you? ",850,0
mturk_agent_1,"Good, any particular item you're looking for?",850,1
mturk_agent_2,My highest need is more food.  I am a diabetic and need to keep my blood sugar up. ,850,1
mturk_agent_1,"Gotcha, we can work on that. Any interest in firewood as well?",850,2
mturk_agent_2,Well I have interest in all of the items but food is most important.  I would like some more wood as I am small and tend to get cold at night.  What is your highest need item?,850,2
mturk_agent_1,"My biggest need is water, it's going to be incredibly hot hot where I'm going so I'm looking for as much as possible. Also, hence the need for not a whole lot of firewood.",850,3
mturk_agent_2,I have the least need for water so I'd be happy to give you the water and I'll take the wood if that's of no use to you.,850,3
mturk_agent_1,"That's perfect, I'd like 1 of the food if possible. However seems like you need the extra bag more than I do.",850,4
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like a good deal to me!,850,4
mturk_agent_1,"Great so 3 waters to me, 3 firewood to you and 1 food for me, 2 for you?",850,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,850,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,850,6
mturk_agent_2,Hello how are you doing today?,851,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'm good, how are you?",851,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am alright, thinking about camping and the time we went camping by the beach in Indiana. You ever camped near a beach?",851,1
mturk_agent_1,"Unfortunately no, but I would love to experience camping, I bet it's a lot of fun.",851,1
mturk_agent_2,It is but you really should not set up a tent on sand. One of my friends tried and it was not good. A lot of bugs in the sand and they didn't even use a tarp.,851,2
mturk_agent_1,"I will take note of that, that's a good thing to consider. How about the things that are needed for camping, what do you think would be the best decision?",851,2
mturk_agent_2,Depends where you are camping. One trip I did during the summer was during extreme heat and most important thing was water. If you are camping in the woods firewood might be low because there is wood all around you.,851,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, that makes sense. I agree that the most important is water regardless of where you are camping because you don't know if there is water where you are going, and if there is you don't know if it is safe for drinking.",851,3
mturk_agent_2,"I have done winter camping and there was fresh water you could drink as long as you boiled it, but firewood was hard to find as most on the ground was rotted.",851,4
mturk_agent_1,"In situation like that, where you have idea of the situation, I think it is important to balance of what extra things that might be needed.",851,4
mturk_agent_2,Would you be open to letting me get 2 waters and I can take 1 of the food and firewood?,851,5
mturk_agent_1,"I think that is a reasonable decision, I agree with your choices.",851,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,851,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,851,6
mturk_agent_1,"Hi. I hope you're doing well. I really need the extra food, so I was hoping to take three of the food as well as three of the firewood.",852,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi there.  Well we are making smoores and really need to start a fire.  The firewood is most important to us.  ,852,0
mturk_agent_1,"Oh no, that's what we need it for, too. I've been telling my daughter about how my dad used to take me camping and taught me to make s'mores. She's so excited! What if we split the firewood?",852,1
mturk_agent_2,That sounds reasonable.  Your dad sounds like mine :)   Do you need water?  I'd be happy to let you have all 3 if we could get at least 2 of the firewood.  🙂🙂,852,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm pretty good on water, thanks. 🙂 How about I'll take one of the waters, three of the food, and only one of the firewood. You can have the other two waters and most of the firewood.",852,2
mturk_agent_2,We are very hungry and didn't bring any snacks.  We were hoping to get 2 of the food and 2 firewood.  We are good on water too.  What do you think?  ,852,2
mturk_agent_1,"I have two teenage boys with me and really need the food. 😮 What if I take two food, one firewood, and two waters? That way we both get our fair share of what's important. 🙂 ",852,3
mturk_agent_2,"I thought you were good on water?  Could we take 2 waters, 2 firewood and 1 food?  ",852,3
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, earlier you said that I could have all three waters if you could have two firewood, so I assumed you didn't any. But I can totally let you have it. 🙂 So I'll take two food, one firewood, and one water.",852,4
mturk_agent_2,That's great thanks.  Deal!,852,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,852,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,852,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, im pretty excited about camping, what about you?",853,0
mturk_agent_2,Yea I am too.,853,0
mturk_agent_1,"i am camping in a pretty damp jungle area, so i would like 3 firewoods please, and maybe 1 of either food or water, your choice",853,1
mturk_agent_2,I think we should split the gear evenly so everyone can be happy.,853,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well if i take 3 firewood, and one of something else, i only get 4 items, you get 5. i think that is fair",853,2
mturk_agent_2,Yes but you are rushing it too quick my friend.,853,2
mturk_agent_1,I see what you mean.🙂,853,3
mturk_agent_2,What are your most important items?,853,3
mturk_agent_1,"Firewood, what about you?",853,4
mturk_agent_2,Me too unfortunately,853,4
mturk_agent_1,"well in that case, you can have all the fire wood, if i can have all the water and 2 foods, that way you get all three of your most important item",853,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,853,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,853,6
mturk_agent_1,i will take 2 firewood 2 food and 1 water,854,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, i would really like to have extra firewood, i like sitting by the fire as long as possible. Would you be willing to let me have 2 firewood, 1 food and 1 water?",854,0
mturk_agent_1,Firewood was also of priority to me but I am willing to give in to your request.,854,1
mturk_agent_2,"Great, thanks, I really appreciate it. ",854,1
mturk_agent_1,you are welcome,854,2
mturk_agent_2,i hope you enjoy your trip,854,2
mturk_agent_1,Have fun friend,854,3
mturk_agent_2,"i will, especially with the extra firewood!",854,3
mturk_agent_1,I am a foodie so I am sure I will like it there,854,4

mturk_agent_1,I am excited too. I hope it will be fun.,855,0
mturk_agent_2,I am a little worried I won't have enough firewood. Are you short on any supplies?,855,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes. I need extra packages of firewood too and water.,855,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I am sure we can come up with a way to divide the supplies so we are both comfortable!",855,2
mturk_agent_1,I will need at least 2 firewood. Will that be okay? I can give up 2 food for you.,855,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good. ,855,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay. Thank you. I knew we could find something working for us.,855,3
mturk_agent_2,"Now just the water, can I take 2 of the water since I only will get one of the firewood?",855,4
mturk_agent_1,I am requesting 2 waters too. I am with my kids and they like playing with water so i know they will waste a lot,855,4
mturk_agent_2,"OK, I can live with that!",855,5
mturk_agent_1,Thank you so much for understanding. Now i am not worried. Do we have a deal?,855,5

mturk_agent_1,I will be bringing my family and the dog.  How about you?,856,3
mturk_agent_2,"It'll be about the same, but my oldest boy is bringing some friends as well. Kind of hard to tell him no since they've been stuck in the house for so long. It'll be a full house (or tent I guess). :D",856,3
mturk_agent_1,Hopefully it will be a fun trip.  I am looking for firewood.  What are you hoping to bring?,856,4
mturk_agent_2,"For the whole crew, I'm thinking I'll need some as well in addition to some other stuff like water and food. ",856,4

mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,856,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,856,6
mturk_agent_1,I would like to get 3 firewoods because I get very cold easily and would be scared to freeze and get ill ☹️. I would like to take 2 waters and 1 food. You can take more food.,857,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I wish we could both have what we want.  I was sick last month and Im afraid of getting very sick again.  I can give you 2 firewood and 1 water but I also need 2 food packages because I get hungry quickly.🙂🙂",857,0
mturk_agent_1,I am happy to give you 2 food packages and take just 1. But I am really hoping that you would let me have 3 firewoods. I am also very afraid of dark and would have to keep fire going all night long. ,857,1
mturk_agent_2,I really think I need two firewood packages because I was ill.  If I had not been sick recently it would be ok to let you have them all.  I will do my best to get along with one package of firewood.    🙂,857,1
mturk_agent_1,I understand your fear. How about if I offer you more water? You could take 2 waters? 🙂🙂,857,2
mturk_agent_2,Ordinarily I would be ok with that but this time I do need one package of firewood.  I🙂,857,2
mturk_agent_1,You mentioned that you get very hungry easily. What if you took all of the food? I usually can tolerate being hungry for longer periods of time but I really fear being in the dark at some point without fire going and no light. 😮,857,3
mturk_agent_2,"Maybe another time that would work but I do need the firewood.  You will have two packages of firewood and Im sure that you will be fine.  I wouldnt leave a burning fire on at night while sleeping, it could be very dangerouss.",857,3
mturk_agent_1,"I have done that before and I am used to that way as I take additional precautions to secure fireplace. If we do not come to conclusion soon, we will both end up getting less.. 😮",857,4
mturk_agent_2,"That is possible, I still need the one package of firewood though.  An unattended fire is dangerous in the woods.",857,4
mturk_agent_1,"So then you would be ok with 1 firewood, 1 water and 2 foods?",857,5
mturk_agent_2,"Yes would work,",857,5

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,857,6

mturk_agent_1,"food would be great after water, firewood is not a concern for me",858,1
mturk_agent_2,Ok I plan to catch my own food so I am pretty good there.  How much water do you need?,858,1
mturk_agent_1,"how would you feel about me getting 2 water, 1 wood, 1 food",858,2
mturk_agent_2,Water really is my priority.  If I only got 1 water would it be possible for me to get all the food?,858,2
mturk_agent_1,"how does me getting 2 water, 0 food, 2 wood work",858,3
mturk_agent_2,"Would you be agreeable to me taking 1 water, 3 firewood and 2 food?",858,3
mturk_agent_1,"thats probably a bit much, youd get 6 items vs my 3. If you would like 2 water - i would do 1 water, 2 food, 2 firewood",858,4

mturk_agent_2,Yes. I want few more extra supplies.,859,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well what are you low on? I myself really need firewood badly, it got wet when some of my water leaked out",859,1
mturk_agent_2,"I myself really need water badly,because I have it already.I need both firewood and food the most.",859,2
mturk_agent_1,"if you can give me 2 water and 2 firewood, you can have 1 water , 1 firewood, and 2 food",859,2
mturk_agent_2,Hey I can give you completely 3 water because I need 3 firewood to keep my surroundings warm and I need 3 food because I have 2 older people with me.,859,3
mturk_agent_1,no way can I give you a total of 6 items for 3 items. If you can give me 3 firewood and 1 water you can have 2 water and 3 food,859,3
mturk_agent_2,I need 3 firewood and 2 food.you take all the three water.,859,4
mturk_agent_1,"if you make it 2 firewood and 2 water you can have the rest, that is the best i can do, that way you get 1 firewood, 1 water and 3 food",859,4

mturk_agent_2,I'm doing well. Just doing some last minute preppy for our camping trip this weekend!,860,0
mturk_agent_1,What are you most look forward to doing?,860,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm very excited for campfires at night! my family loves to camp. I am a little concerned about how chilly it's going to be outside. I want to make sure it's warm enough. I could really use 3 extra packages of firewood. ,860,1
mturk_agent_1,I love sitting around the fire as well. I feel like you can never have enough firewood. It's also a great protector against anything that may be lurking around.,860,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes exactly. It's really important for a good camping experience. We currently have a foster child with us and they have never been camping, so I want to give them the best experience because he deserves it! 🙂",860,2
mturk_agent_1,Wow that is so awesome! I hope they have the best time. I have some firewood I'm able to provide to you. Is 2 packages okay?,860,3
mturk_agent_2,I would maybe be able to get by with 2. If I could get 2 more packages of food that doesn't need to be cooked over a fire. Another package of water would also helpful since I won't be able to boil as much over the fire. ,860,3
mturk_agent_1,"I could definitely give you 2 packages of firewood! My family goes through water like crazy! My son and his father both drink like a fish. And food! I swear they eat me out of the house. Now that I'm thinking, if I could get 2 packages of water and a package of food, I could provide you with the 3 extra firewood packages I have! If that works for you?",860,4
mturk_agent_2,"So let me see if we are on the same page here. I would get 3 firewood 2 food, and no water?",860,4
mturk_agent_1,If that is okay. I know you need the firewood more than anything else. We definitely need more water.,860,5
mturk_agent_2,I would appreciate that so much. I think that is an agreement that is a huge blessing for me and my family 🙂,860,5

mturk_agent_2,I'm most interested in firewood.  How about you?,861,1
mturk_agent_1,I am also most interested in the firewood.  I need it to keep my new baby warm.  ,861,2
mturk_agent_2,I understand.  Being cold while camping can make for a long miserable trip.  What are you least interested in?,861,2
mturk_agent_1,"I am least interested in the water, I have plenty of that already.  What about you?",861,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'm planning on fishing for food, so I'm least interested in food",861,3
mturk_agent_1,Oh that makes sense.  How clever of you to fish!  Well you can have all 3 of my waters if I can have 2 of the firewood and 2 of the food.,861,4

mturk_agent_1,I like snacks too lol! I want to be sure I have a lot of water for my hike. I would like all three waters if you want all three food.,862,2
mturk_agent_2,OK. That will work.,862,3
mturk_agent_1,Great! I think one extra firewood is good for me so you can have 2 of those and we will be set. Have fun!,862,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok that will work for me too. You are very kind. ,862,4
mturk_agent_1,You as well. If I bump into you and your friends I'll say hello 🙂,862,4
mturk_agent_2,Ok sounds good. Let me set the deal for us. Have a good trip. ,862,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,862,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,862,6
mturk_agent_1,"hi, how are you",863,0
mturk_agent_2,I am okay.  Stressed.  In need of some decompression via camping.,863,0
mturk_agent_1,"okay ,what you want ?",863,1
mturk_agent_2,"I am looking forward to doing some extra hiking.  Can I get all the food, and I'll give you all the firewood?",863,1
mturk_agent_1,"i am so sorry, i will give 1 pack of food, 1 pack of water and 2 pack firewood",863,2
mturk_agent_2,Then I will walk 🙂 ,863,2
mturk_agent_1,okay please explain how many pack you want?,863,3
mturk_agent_2,"Two packs of food, two packs of water, one firewood. ",863,3
mturk_agent_1,"sorry i want 2 pack food, i will give one pack of food and two pack of water, two pack of firewood?",863,4
mturk_agent_2,That won't work for me. ,863,4
mturk_agent_1,okay accepted deals,863,5
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,863,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hey neighbor. I bet you're looking forward to your camping trip, as am I! Looks like we should divide up the remaining supplies between us. What's most important to you?",864,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah! I am ok with that, we can divide the remaining supplies between us.",864,0
mturk_agent_1,"Well let's start with food first. Food's pretty important to me, since I'll be camping in a remote area without much access to food.😮 How would you feel about letting me have all 3 of those?",864,1
mturk_agent_2,"Food is very important for me too, for me to survive over there I would need food too. I would give you half of it.",864,1
mturk_agent_1,Hmm food seems important to both of us. How do you feel about firewood and water?,864,2
mturk_agent_2,There is a saying that water does not have enemy. I would need water for domestic use and I would need firewood in other to keep myself warm and as a source of energy in the night.,864,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ah then it sounds like we want all of the same things then, but we must sacrifice something for the good of everyone. What is more of a priority for you, firewood or food?",864,3
mturk_agent_2,"Both are very important to me, but I would likely go for food, food is more important",864,3
mturk_agent_1,"Understood completely. I'm interested in food more than firewood as well. How would you feel if I took 2 Food, 1 Firewood, and all 3 Waters?🙂",864,4
mturk_agent_2,"The food you took is much, please take 1 food, 2 firewood and 2 water",864,4
mturk_agent_1,"I think food is the tricky one here. How about this: you take ALL the firewood, and I'll take all the water. Would you be willing to let me have 2 food then?",864,5
mturk_agent_2,"Take 1 food, you take all the firewood and 1 water. Let's do it like that",864,5
mturk_agent_1,"That's a non-starter unfortunately. ☹️I'd be willing to let you have 2 food if you give me 1 firewood. You get 2 food and 2 firewood, and I get what's left.",864,6
mturk_agent_2,I think I am ok with the 2 food and the 1 firewood. You can get what is left. Thank you,864,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,864,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,864,7
mturk_agent_2,I would like you to have the extra food because we have a high need for water.,865,0
mturk_agent_1,Sure that works for me! I'd like extra firewood so that we can ward off any wild animals and so we can see that night. And to roast marshmallows around a campfire :D,865,0
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good however my camping buddy is unusually thin and gets chilled quickly. I am hoping the extra food will be worth two firewoods for us. You can still roast marshmellos with the wood you already have.🙂,865,1
mturk_agent_1,"If your camping buddy is unusually thin, I feel like it'll be best for you folks to have more food. I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of food for more water instead. How about you guys take 2 units of food and I'll keep one? Eating food will help you stay warm since your body temperature goes up🙂",865,1
mturk_agent_2,That is a good idea! We can give you a water and your can give us a food. I will encourage him to eat because he has weight problems. Are you otherwise okay with our distribution?,865,2
mturk_agent_1,"Awesome, I'm glad we can agree on that :D Since I'm not getting any extra food, is it possible for me to have more firewood? Having just water isn't going to be able to sustain us, I'll need the firewood to cook some fish that we'll need to catch on our own 😮",865,2
mturk_agent_2,"How about you have 2 firewood units, 1 water, and 1 food. We can wrap up if we get cold. Oh, and good luck fishing!",865,3
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, that sounds fantastic! :D I'm all about being one with nature and enjoying what the wilderness has to offer lol. ",865,3
mturk_agent_2,Camping is great and I am glad you do not have to depend on your fishing to eat.🙂 It looks like we are in agreement with the extra provisions. Just check the chart to be sure I did it as we agreed!,865,4
mturk_agent_1,Sure thing! I hope you two have a wonderful camping trip! Make sure he eats okay? ,865,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,865,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,865,5
mturk_agent_1,"hello, i'll be going on a camping trip soon",866,0
mturk_agent_2,me too - with my teenage sons who eat me out of house and home! ,866,0
mturk_agent_1,"haha ya, well i am going to be needing 3 water considering how thirsty i can get",866,1
mturk_agent_2,"ha! How about i take 3 food, 1 firewood and a water and you can have the rest? ",866,1
mturk_agent_1,"i would counter with 2 food, 3 wood, and 0 water",866,2
mturk_agent_2,"I can accept that - i take 2 food 3 wood and no water, you get 1 food and 3 water? ",866,2
mturk_agent_1,"correct, that sounds good to me",866,3
mturk_agent_2,"fantastic- works for me as well, that will at least get me through a day or so with these kids",866,3
mturk_agent_1,ya it definitely will get me through my camping trip as well,866,4
mturk_agent_2,sounds great! ,866,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,866,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,866,5
mturk_agent_1,"I definitely need some wood, water and food.",867,0
mturk_agent_2,Hey what sup. There's no need to rush.,867,0
mturk_agent_1,OK. :0,867,1
mturk_agent_2,Is that your priority order?,867,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well I need 2 packs of water, 2 pack of food and 1 pack of wood, since I have a butane lighter",867,2
mturk_agent_2,That deal is quite unfair for me.,867,2
mturk_agent_1,I am not sure why there is no ammo packs to hunt for Elk and Buffalo. 🙂,867,3
mturk_agent_2,There is a way to evenly split the camping gear if you want a fair deal.,867,3
mturk_agent_1,OK. How about 1 pack of water for me and 1 pack of food and 1 pack of firewood for me.,867,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok if you want that deal, I'm fine with it.",867,4
mturk_agent_1,OK. ,867,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,867,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,867,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hello I am Sandra I would like to know if I could get three thing 2 fire wood, 1 water because of extra family members joinings of water ,",868,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey Sandra, good to chat to you",868,0
mturk_agent_2,same here sodo you think you can help me.🙂,868,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can definitely give you the 2 fire wood, but I'd like to keep all 3 water if possible - since we're going on a long hike",868,1
mturk_agent_2,"I will take the 2 fire wood, I would like to have 1 water please because of other family member joining, we are going on a long run.",868,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, fine I will take 2 waters and 1 firewood in that case. How should we split the food?",868,2
mturk_agent_2,"I get one , you take one so we good.🙂",868,3
mturk_agent_1,"There are 3 food altogether, are you okay if I took 2 and you take 1?",868,3
mturk_agent_2,Yes that is fine🙂,868,4
mturk_agent_1,"Great, let's settle on this then!",868,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,868,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,868,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello I would like to get some food and firewood if that's ok with you. I hope to make my family a delicious meal. ,869,0
mturk_agent_1,Sure no problem; how much firewood do you need?,869,0
mturk_agent_2,Food is more of a priority but two of them and one water would be good I think,869,1
mturk_agent_1,I understand you completely. What exactly were you planning to make with these items?,869,1
mturk_agent_2,I will be making some flame grilled steak. ,869,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds very yummy. Is there a particular reason you want to make that dish?,869,2
mturk_agent_2,No I just think of myself as a chef so I like to make cool dishes. ,869,3
mturk_agent_1,Oh that's nice. 😡 How badly would you need these items?,869,3
mturk_agent_2,What's with the angry face? I need my two food and firewood items very badly. ,869,4
mturk_agent_1,"Does my face look angry? Nah, it is just your impression. Anyways, do you think that if I gave you the items that you would cook a good meal?",869,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,869,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,869,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello there.,87,0
mturk_agent_1,hiii,87,0
mturk_agent_2,"So in order to fully enjoy my on this trip while surviving, I will require mass quantities of food.",87,1
mturk_agent_1,k i need food as first priority,87,1
mturk_agent_2,Unacceptable,87,2
mturk_agent_1,why,87,2
mturk_agent_2,I require the majority of food as I have explained.,87,3
mturk_agent_1,what is priority pls tell me,87,3
mturk_agent_2,"As I have explained now twice, it is obviously food.",87,4
mturk_agent_1,"k, then 2 is for u 1 for me but i need remaining two as per my priority",87,4
mturk_agent_2,What does that mean?,87,5
mturk_agent_1,means water and firewood  i need majority then only it will balence,87,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,87,6
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,87,6
mturk_agent_1,make firewood majority for me,87,7
mturk_agent_2,unacceptable.  I am giving you food as your priority as you requested.  I require compensation for that.,87,7
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,87,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,87,8
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how are you?",870,0
mturk_agent_1,I am good how are you doing today?,870,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well thanks, do you have a priority of the three items to share?",870,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes I do and it reminds me of when I went winter camping. Have you ever camped during the winter?,870,1
mturk_agent_2,"No i haven't, usually only in the warmer weather due to my age and limitations. What does it remind you of?",870,2
mturk_agent_1,Well I went camping in the winter before and we needed to bring lots of firewood to keep warm. Also water was near by but needed to be boiled.,870,2
mturk_agent_2,I understand. Firewood would be crucial with the cold and the need to boil water to drink. How about you take 2 of the 3 firewood supplies then,870,3
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds good, would you want 2 of the food and waters then?",870,3
mturk_agent_2,"I need more of the water as i battle kidney issues, are you good with only 1 of the food, do you hunt?",870,4
mturk_agent_1,I have done some fishing in the past that is fun. Ice fishing is interesting. I can give you all the waters.,870,4
mturk_agent_2,"That would be very kind and generous, so you take 2 firewood, 1 food and how about 1 water just to be fair, deal?",870,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,870,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,870,6
mturk_agent_1,Hello! I'm looking forward to this camping trip!,871,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, Nice to interact with you. Hope all well and let's begin with our requirements.",871,0
mturk_agent_1,"I'd really like extra firewood, my kids like to make lots of s'mores.",871,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, I can manage with it. I would need more food in that case.",871,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's OK, although water is the thing I need least of. My teenages eat a lot but only drink flavored beverages :/",871,2
mturk_agent_2,"So, can I have 2 packages of food.",871,2
mturk_agent_1,"If I can have all the firewood, you can have 2 packages of food yes.",871,3
mturk_agent_2,Hmm ok ☹️ I thought I can have 1 of firewood in case of emergency. What about 2-1 of food and 1-2 of firewood.,871,3
mturk_agent_1,"That might work, but how do you feel about the water? I may actually need it for making tea and coffee. Can I get 2 water also?",871,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that's fine",871,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,871,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,871,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I prefer to acquire firewood for cooking and water for hiking long trails.,872,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello! I really need water myself--I didn't bring enough to go hiking, and it's going to be hotter than I planned for. And I really wanted to go on a long hike ☹️ How about this: I get all the water, and you can have all the firewood? I don't need firewood so much, really.",872,0
mturk_agent_1,"I really like hiking also, as i have a habit of running a lot. So i would give extra firewood and food for extra water.",872,1
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, how about this: you get all the firewood and one water, and I get two water?",872,1
mturk_agent_1,For two water I will give all food and one firewood,872,2
mturk_agent_2,"No, thanks. I really need water a lot, and I don't want firewood all that much.",872,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I like your previous deal! ",872,3
mturk_agent_2,"Cool! So, 3 firewood for you and 1 water, 2 water for me; how should we split the food?",872,3
mturk_agent_1,I keep all food.,872,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, that doesn't work for me, because that means you get 7 items and I get 2.",872,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, well I'll give 1 food",872,5
mturk_agent_2,Give me 2 food and we'll have a deal.,872,5
mturk_agent_1,Again.3 food and 1 firewood for 2 water,872,6
mturk_agent_2,"If I don't get at least 4 items total, I'm walking.",872,6
mturk_agent_1,Okay 2 water for 3 food and 2 firewood,872,7
mturk_agent_2,"How about I get 2 water and 2 food, you get 3 firewood and 2 food?",872,7
mturk_agent_1,Fine. It's a dealllllll,872,8
mturk_agent_2,Sweet! Thanks a lot 🙂,872,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,872,9
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,872,9
mturk_agent_2,"Hi! I'm super excited to go camping with my family, especially since we haven't been able to get out of the house due to Covid. Are you going camping too?",873,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes I am! I'm going camping way up north so it's going to be super super cold. Is it okay if I take all the firewood?,873,0
mturk_agent_2,Super cold up north? Its August right now. Are you going to be ok? Should you also take water and food?,873,1
mturk_agent_1,"Even though it's August it can actually get pretty cold at night. Currently it's 70 where I live and that's at noon when it's the warmest! And no, I don't need as much water for example because my mom stockpiled it all during COVID. ",873,1
mturk_agent_2,So you plan to be sleeping outside instead of in a tent?We're planning on doing a lot of fishing and we want to cook the fish we catch over a campfire every night...,873,2
mturk_agent_1,"I'll definitely be sleeping inside...but my family loves sitting around the campfire late into the night. We normally don't sleep a lot when camping haha. How about I take 2 Firewood, and you take 1. I can offer you more food to make up for the fish tho! ",873,2
mturk_agent_2,"Mmmm... I dunno... I've packed food for ""just in case"" but we're really planning moreso to cook the fish we catch than pack more food. My husband wants to do this trail where we hike along the perimeter of the lake and set up camp every night",873,3
mturk_agent_1,Could you then offer a deal? I'm getting impatient and will leave soon. I'm thinking 2 firewood for me and 1 for you. And 2 food for you and 1 for me. If it makes you happy you can also have 2 water. ,873,3
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, I've got other things to do in addition to this negotiation. And I don't really have a grasp on how important these resources are you to you and why I should give in to your demands.",873,4
mturk_agent_1,Well then offer a counterdeal! I don't understand what you want me to do if you're not giving options lol,873,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,873,5
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,873,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,873,6
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,873,6
mturk_agent_2,"I thought you wanted firewood so badly, that's why I proposed the previous deal. I originally wanted firewood but since you're being so rude, I figured I'd give in to your selfish demand and offer all of the firewood to you.",873,7
mturk_agent_1,"I don't appreciate the rude tone😮. I thank you for that, but you're still getting more out of the deal than I am . If I could just have 1 additional water I would be satisfied! And according to my calculations, you come out on the better side! 🙂",873,7
mturk_agent_2,"I know you don't appreciate it because its not what you want to hear.  If I give you 1 water, it does not come out with me on the better side, I'm worse off.",873,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,873,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,873,9
mturk_agent_2,So I was thinking I'd take 2 waters and only 1 of the firewood and food.,874,0
mturk_agent_1,Would you be open to doing that the other way around?,874,0
mturk_agent_2,I don't know.  I really don't think I have enough water to cover all the hiking.  I could definitely use extra.  ,874,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, I'm in the same boat, I'm one of those types that is overly cautious and like having as much water as possible, just in case.",874,1
mturk_agent_2,Hm.  Well what about firewood?  How are you with that?  ,874,2
mturk_agent_1,"I could do with or without a fire, it's not a top priority like food and water",874,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well I have trouble with starting fires, so the extra firewood would be beneficial to me...I know I'll need a fire going each night.  So what if I took all 3 firewood and then you could have the majority of the water?",874,3
mturk_agent_1,"so you would get 1 water, 1 food and 3 firewood?",874,3
mturk_agent_2,"I would be interested in negotiating for a little more food in that case, but yes, otherwise that is what I am proposing. 🙂",874,4
mturk_agent_1,"well, that would put you at 6 items and me at 3",874,4
mturk_agent_2,"Well you didn't really need the firewood right?  I, on the other hand, could use all of it.  If I'm willing to take only 1 food package, are you good with the deal?",874,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,874,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,874,6
mturk_agent_1,Hi - I see we are looking to make a trade before our camping trip 🙂,875,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that's right! And I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that's good for both of us.",875,0
mturk_agent_1,What do you prefer to trade with the most?,875,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'd like at least 1 firewood and 2 waters. The water especially because I only have 1 jug of water, and I don't want to get dehydrated with all the hiking I'm going to do. What do you prefer most?",875,1
mturk_agent_1,I also don't want to get dehydrated as my spouse likes to call me a water buffalo with the amount of water I consume.  I am willing to forgo the firewood if I can get 3 food and 3 waters. ,875,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ha! That's hilarious. I love it. I can do with just 1 water, then, but I'm going to need at least 1 food, too. I burn calories so quickly that I'm getting hungry just in this chat.:) 🙂",875,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, if you need 1 of each food and water, can I get 1 firewood?  That would make me 1 firewood, 2 food, and 2 water.  you:  2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water?",875,3
mturk_agent_2,"Hmmm, I don't know. I really need that firewood. It's gonna be cold, so I need all of the firewood I can get to keep warm. Last time I went camping without, it was miserable. Felt like I was going to shiver to death. ☹️ Is that one a necessity for you?",875,3
mturk_agent_1,"That one is if I can't keep warm with my food.  I think it would be ok if I got the extra food.   Otherwise, I run on empty with no warm food to eat and then no firewood to keep me warm 🙂.  How about me:  3 food, 1 water, no firewood then?",875,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I'd be willing to go for that, and thanks for understanding! That works for you as well?",875,4
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, I meant to say 3 food, 2 waters....☹️.  My apologies - see that's where my lack of water gets me....all confused and bothered 😮",875,5
mturk_agent_2,"Ha! That's a good one. Okay, you drive a hard bargain, but 3 foods and 2 waters to you, the rest to me. That sound good? Full of hydrated clarity? 😮",875,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,875,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,875,6
mturk_agent_1,"hello, hope you are well. more than anything i need extra firewood as looks like going to be extra cold on my camping trip. what are you needing the most?",876,0
mturk_agent_2,I am also going to need firewood the most. I would be willing to give extra food for it.,876,0
mturk_agent_1,i bought a lot of extra food. but what about if you get 2 firewood and then 1 water and food. and i get 1 firewood and 2 water and 2 food?,876,1
mturk_agent_2,"That's not bad, but I would rather have 2 firewood, 2 water and 1 food.",876,1
mturk_agent_1,i hear ya but water is my 2nd biggest need after firewood as will be doing a lot of hiking so can't really get by with just 1 of my top 2 needs in firewood and water. only way could do that is if received all the food.,876,2
mturk_agent_2,I think that may be an acceptable deal but I would need to eat something so I don't know if I would be able to give all of the food to you. I still think 1 firewood and 1 water and two food is a good deal for you. I need the extra water to take my medicines with in the morning.,876,2
mturk_agent_1,i think whoever gets 2 firewood should only get 1 water as that only seems fair. would you take only 1 firewood and 1 water if those your top 2 needs?,876,3
mturk_agent_2,"I may be able to give you all three of the food if you let me have 2 firewood and 2 water, other than that I may have to end this negotiation.",876,3
mturk_agent_1,"good grief. i need food the least. how bout you get 2 firewood, 1 water, and 2 food. so you get more of your top need and 5 items overall. i will take 1 firewood, 2 water, and 1 food. 1 get 4 items and 2 of my 2nd most need? way more than fair to you. sound good?",876,4
mturk_agent_2,Do you wonder what my top needs are at all? Apparently not. I guess this negotiation is going nowhere.,876,4
mturk_agent_1,you told me this after i asked....I am also going to need firewood the most. I would be willing to give extra food for it.,876,5
mturk_agent_2,I would be willing to get 2 firewood and 1 water an 1 food so you are happy and end up with the most things. As long as I get the firewood. I guess I will have to go without my medicine.,876,5

mturk_agent_1,"hello. I want to take the three food package, you can have the firewood",877,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello. I love to have all firewood but I cannot live through this without food☹️. I get hungry often and need to eat many times throughout the day. I would like to have food as well.😮,877,0
mturk_agent_1,"what if I give you one food and all the wood and one water, so I can have two food and two waters?",877,1
mturk_agent_2,That seems reasonable enough to me. Would you consider at all giving me more food? ,877,1
mturk_agent_1,I think that offer is pretty good. we got four items each,877,2
mturk_agent_2,It does seem fair at the end of the day. I just wished to get more food 🙂.,877,2
mturk_agent_1,"🙂 I know, food is never really too much. but I really need the two portions of food ",877,3
mturk_agent_2,"I understand because I really need firewood the most as I get very cold and freeze easily, and I would have to burn it throughout night because I am scared of dark🙂🙂",877,3
mturk_agent_1,"then we got ourselves a deal. so 2 food and two water for me, right?",877,4
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good.,877,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,877,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,877,5
mturk_agent_1,I have little babies with me. I need a lot of water. Can you give me all the 3 water?,878,0
mturk_agent_2,No. That will not be possible because i will need a lot of it too.,878,0
mturk_agent_1,I can then give up 1 water and you take 2 of any of the remaining that you will choose.,878,1
mturk_agent_2,If you give me one water then i will take all the food and 2 firewood.,878,1
mturk_agent_1,That I will need to walk away friend,878,2
mturk_agent_2,Why walk away when we can agree? You need to consider me too.,878,2
mturk_agent_1,"You are taking almost everything. I can offer you 1 water, 2 food and 1 firewood. It is fair.",878,3
mturk_agent_2,"It's not fair. That means you take most of almost everything. Can i take 3 food, 1 water and 1 firewood?",878,3
mturk_agent_1,I also need food please,878,4
mturk_agent_2,Okay then. What if i give you 1 food and you give me another water? I have a condition that requires a lot of water.,878,4
mturk_agent_1,"With water, I can not do with less than 2 water. then i can give you 2 food and 2 firewood. Is that not fair enough?",878,5
mturk_agent_2,I think that will be better. Though water is my top priority.,878,5
mturk_agent_1,Do we have a deal?,878,6
mturk_agent_2,It seems you are not ready to give up any more water. ,878,6
mturk_agent_1,No. I am fair. I have taken 2 water and 1 food and 1 firewood,878,7
mturk_agent_2,Okay,878,7
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,878,8
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,878,8
mturk_agent_2,What do you have in mind?,879,0
mturk_agent_1,"I need additional packages of water, given that I get dehydrated fast.",879,0
mturk_agent_2,I understand I have that issue as well. I will likly die on one  package . If i get two i will share it with you we can ration it ,879,1
mturk_agent_1,"This is something we will have to work on, how about we can share 2-1?",879,1
mturk_agent_2,I will need 2 and give you one. I am willing to pass on the fire wood meaning. I get 2 packages of water and you get access to it an emergency.,879,2
mturk_agent_1,"In that case, I will need more of food.",879,2
mturk_agent_2,that could work 2-1 for food; fire wood could be shared I know how to store it incase of rain and am a skilled out doors man. ,879,3
mturk_agent_1,What are your thoughts on how to share firewood?,879,3
mturk_agent_2,I am a skilled outdoorsmen If you let me hold all the firewood I would be able to perserve it. ,879,4
mturk_agent_1,"Appreciate it. But, it's not advisable to rely on skills, we never know what situation can we expect?",879,4
mturk_agent_2,Thats true--But I am concerned about you if something happens to me you may not be able to utlise it. Maybe you could but I think we would both benfit if I held all the fire wood that way I could teach you some tricks.,879,5
mturk_agent_1,"That is so nice of you to be concerned of me. But, yes, I need to think of the food as well and would need firewood.",879,5
mturk_agent_2,Yeah I agree that you could hold the food 2-1 that way there is a system of checks and balances.,879,6
mturk_agent_1,Hmm..this is between thinking of the present and future. My reasoning is concerning the present.,879,6
mturk_agent_2,agreed but like you never know what situation we can expect. you control the food and have intrest and acess to the water with me holding the firewood ,879,7
mturk_agent_1,"No, that would be unfair to you..My suggestion is to we will either decide on water or Food and firewood. Like 2-1 of the former and 1-2 of the latter.",879,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,879,8
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,879,8
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I'm excited for our camping trip!",88,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey buddy, yes I'm so pumped for it.",88,0
mturk_agent_2,Okay so I'm planning this super cool backpacking expedition up the waterfall but I'm going to need all the additional water and food for everyone.,88,1
mturk_agent_1,All of the additional water and food? That doesn't seem very fair. ☹️,88,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well I'll be splitting it with everyone on the trip as we go up. The people that choose to stay will still get all their basic supplies of food and water. The backpacking trip is going to take three days though, we're gonna need the resources😮",88,2
mturk_agent_1,I see. Which resource do you desire most?,88,2
mturk_agent_2,Well I was thinking you could get all the extra firewood and work on the group meal and bonfire for friday night,88,3
mturk_agent_1,"I like the sound of getting the firewood, but I can't just accept no food or water.",88,3
mturk_agent_2,"I'll give you one of the extra food so you have a little extra to cook for everyone but I'm really gonna need all that extra water, it's going to be really hot this weekend and the folks at the capsite get to sit in the shade all day",88,4
mturk_agent_1,"Now we are making progress. But come on, I will need at least one water to make sure I'm hydrated. I wouldn't want to get heatstroke out in the woods.",88,4
mturk_agent_2,"The basic supplies include water, the additional supplies are just extra. Plus I think there's a well nearby!",88,5

mturk_agent_2,"I find the woods to be exceedingly relaxing.  A good way to decompress, don't you agree? ",880,1
mturk_agent_1,"I do agree, we try and get out there at least once a month during the warmer months. ",880,1
mturk_agent_2,"What is your favorite part of the trip? I think mine is staying up late around a campfire, singing songs and telling stories. Gonna make sure to bring my guitar. ",880,2
mturk_agent_1,"We love cooking on the open fire. Since we are all Chefs, its a great relaxing experience for us. ",880,2
mturk_agent_2,"With that in mind, how would you like to divvy up these extra supplies? ",880,3
mturk_agent_1,"We would love to have extra food, since we love to cook. that being said, we will need a  fair bit of firewood too, to keep the fire going strong. you?",880,3
mturk_agent_2,"Firewood is very important to me.  Water is something I'll need too, since I sweat a lot. ",880,4
mturk_agent_1,Water we don't need much of. Just Food and Firewood,880,4
mturk_agent_2,"Firewood is important to me too.  If I give you all of the extra food, can I have two pieces of firewood? ",880,5
mturk_agent_1,I would prefer to have 2 packages of wood. You can have all the water,880,5
mturk_agent_2,I can give you two pieces of wood but I will need to retain one box of food. ,880,6

mturk_agent_1,"This is true. 🙂.  I'm heading out to Kofa National Wildlife resort in AZ, you?",881,2
mturk_agent_2,I would rather not say.  What is your main focus?,881,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I'm gonna be out in the desert, so ... I might need some extra water..., and food too, since I'm taking my sisters kids w/ me...",881,3
mturk_agent_2,"I will allow or the other, not both.",881,3
mturk_agent_1,"how about I get all the water, and 1 food, and 2 extra firewood as well?",881,4
mturk_agent_2,"How about no.  You can have all the water, I get 2 food and 3 firewood.",881,4
mturk_agent_1,"I need at least 1 firewood, 3 water, and 1 food",881,5
mturk_agent_2,"That's too bad.  You get all the water, I get my compensation for doing so.",881,5
mturk_agent_1,"no deal, Howie!",881,6

mturk_agent_1,I am very excited too I have never been camping!,882,0
mturk_agent_2,"wow, I thought everyone has camped once😮",882,1
mturk_agent_1,Not me!  I don't really love the outdoors too much 😮,882,1
mturk_agent_2,"oh, okay, well will be hiking and could use all 3 waters",882,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well I know that I can go without water for a little, but knowing how hot the weather is supposed to be this week I could really use the water, as well.  I would be okay with me taking a water and you taking two since you will be doing physical exercise.",882,2
mturk_agent_2,"great, you can have all the food and i'll take all the firewood?",882,3
mturk_agent_1,"Or, we could split those as well.  I was thinking about splitting the firewood two to one so that I could definitely stay warm.  I would want to stay up around the fire probably all night so I would much prefer having more of that.",882,3
mturk_agent_2,i would prefer 2 firewood and 1 food. we will be catching fish to eat,882,4
mturk_agent_1,Well the firewood is how we are going to make our food.,882,4
mturk_agent_2,"ok, so I'll take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food?",882,5

mturk_agent_1,Hello there! Excited for your camping trip?,883,0
mturk_agent_2,I am. The family is almost packed. They're pretty excited too.,883,0
mturk_agent_1,Me too. Can't wait to get out there and get started. All that remains is dividing up these final items. Is there anything in aprticular you're itching to get your hands on?,883,1
mturk_agent_2,"My kids eat a lot, so food is the priority. Everything after food plays second to that. You?",883,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm building a mighty bonfire to honor my pagan god, so extra firewood is ideal for me! 🙂 Having extra water on hand would also be a plus in case the flames get out of control.",883,2
mturk_agent_2,That's pretty exciting. There are 9 parcels to agree on. I would be comfortable making as near a split as can be given our preferences and values.,883,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well it seems like Firewood is most important to me, and Food is most important to you. I think You taking all the Food and me taking all the Firewood is a good starting point. That just leaves us with dividing up the Water.",883,3
mturk_agent_2,"Agreed. Water is usually plentiful, so we are not as worried for finding it to drink. I would defer to you on the plus end of water. Say 2:1?",883,3
mturk_agent_1,"Very generous of you! 🙂 I think we've come up with a good deal. You take 3 Food and 1 Water, I take the remainder.",883,4
mturk_agent_2,I would take that deal.,883,4

mturk_agent_1,Ok that works for me and then for firewood what would you like ,884,3
mturk_agent_2,I should be fine with one,884,3

mturk_agent_2,"well, probably enjoying the wide life and all. ",885,1
mturk_agent_1,🙂thats cool. I enjoy hiking a lot and taking photos. What supplies would you require?,885,2
mturk_agent_2,"well i am kinda scared of height so is a no no for me. i need like 3 fire woods, 2 waters and just a food will be okay for me.",885,2
mturk_agent_1,"I do need more water, since hiking takes a physical toll. So, could I get 2 water and 1 Food and 1 Firewood?",885,3
mturk_agent_2,🙂well sounds reasonable but can i get 2 fire woods 2 water and 1 food,885,3
mturk_agent_1,How about 3 firewood and 2 water?,885,4
mturk_agent_2,okay that is a deal,885,4

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,885,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, how's it going",886,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello there! how are you? hoping today is finding you well. I am taking a group of 40 kids camping, lots of work on my end. I was wondering, if its okay with you, will it be okay if I get all 3 waters? the needs of children differ from adults, I feel. the amount of water being spilled will be tremendous. I also need the extra supplies, for cooking, cleaning, and putting out camp fire, I am willing to give you 3 foods in exchange? what are your thoughts?",886,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well I was really hoping to get some Water as well, would you be willing to part with 1 Water for 1 food?",886,1
mturk_agent_1,"So sorry I completely understand, If i was in your shoes I would also would want the extra water. will you be okay if I gave you 2 firewood and 3 foods for all 3 waters? So sorry, I really need the water, ",886,1
mturk_agent_2,I feel like that still has me giving up a lot by not taking any extra water. Would you be willing to sacrifice all the firewood?,886,2
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, believe me. may I ask how many camp members are coming along? children? or are you camping alone?",886,2
mturk_agent_2,"Its me, my wife, and my son camping. I understand your need for the extra water, but I have almost no need for the extra firewood. ",886,3
mturk_agent_1,"I understand, i will feel horrible if your child needed the extra water. I am willing to give you a water. I am in need of Firewood and I have sufficient Food for all of my 40 kids. Will it be okay If i get 2 fire woods and you get 2 foods?",886,3
mturk_agent_2,"1 Water, 2 food, and 1 firewood works for me.",886,4
mturk_agent_1,"Perfect! I will be getting 2 waters, 2 FW, and 1 food. Since you were so nice and understood my need. I am willing to give you all of my food. That way it feels you are getting a better deal",886,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,886,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,886,5
mturk_agent_1,Hey there. I really love camping. How's it going over there?,887,0
mturk_agent_2,I do too! i can't wait to go.,887,0
mturk_agent_1,So are there any supplies you are trying to collect extra of for this trip?,887,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes! i really need to get extra water and some food for the big group going with me.,887,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh what a coincidence! I also am trying to collect extra water and food to take care of the orphaned bears I came across near the camp site,887,2
mturk_agent_2,"Orphaned bears huh? Well, maybe if you could help freed some of the humans I'll be with we could share some with the bears. What if we get 2 food, 1 water, and 2 firewood for the humans?",887,2
mturk_agent_1,"hmmm I don't know about that. If you think that is a good deal, then let's reverse it so the bears can get what you suggest. 🙂The bears thank you!",887,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think the humans would be ok with 1 food, 2 water, and 3 firewood if the bears are really hungry",887,3
mturk_agent_1,I see you are quite the negotiator. How about this? You can have 3 waters and 1 firewood and we'll call it even!,887,4
mturk_agent_2,that's not really even. You're getting all of the food which we both need the most. so I'll take 3 waters and 2 firewood.,887,4
mturk_agent_1,"ok, well if you think what I offered was not even, I will take 3 waters and 1 firewood🙂",887,5

mturk_agent_2,Hello! I'm excited for the trip but I'm still missing a few items.,888,0
mturk_agent_1,What is it that you need?,888,1
mturk_agent_2,"Food mostly, I'm willing to give up 2 waters in exchange for more food.",888,1
mturk_agent_1,"I really need food also. But I'm sure we can work something out. What about I take 1 food, 2 water and all firewood?",888,2
mturk_agent_2,"That's a good deal, but I need a little bit  more firewood. What if I give you 1 food, all the water, and 2 firewood?",888,2
mturk_agent_1,That will work for me. ,888,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds great!! 🙂 🙂,888,3
mturk_agent_1,I'm glad we could come up with something that works for both of us ,888,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hello there, I would like to request that I get extra food due to my blood sugar issue.",889,0
mturk_agent_1,"oh yes, i totally understand!  I am most interested in water.  What if you get 3 food and i get 3 water?",889,0
mturk_agent_2,"That was exactly my thought process, the firewood is an issue though since there is no way to divide it evenly.",889,1
mturk_agent_1,"yes, we'll have to split it!!  I'll have my kids with me and would love to have 2 firewood bundles to make sure they stay warm, but i don't want to be greedy!",889,1
mturk_agent_2,Unfortunately I am anemic so If I do not get 2 extra firewood the last portion of my trip would be dreadful.,889,2
mturk_agent_1,would you be willing to give up 1 bundle of food for 2 woods?  so you would get 2 food and 2 wood?,889,2
mturk_agent_2,☹️ I simply cannot give up any food. I am sorry.,889,3
mturk_agent_1,"darn!  ok let's say you get 3 food  and 2 wood, i take 3 water and 1 wood.  ",889,3
mturk_agent_2,"🙂 Thank you, I think we can come to an agreement. I am sorry about your children. Hopefully they wont be too cold.",889,4

mturk_agent_2,"I have been camping before, but it has been a while. You?",89,1
mturk_agent_1,Same for me!!,89,2
mturk_agent_2,What sort of extra supplies are you looking for?,89,2
mturk_agent_1,I would really appreciate if I am able to take 2 of the food packages since I am a vegan and its hard to find options in the woods and if i can have 2 or 3 of the waters because i have a baby coming with me and i need it for his formula! ,89,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think I can help with that, but in exchange, can I have 3 firewood bundles? I hate to take from the forest and risk damaging the natural wildlife habitat.",89,3
mturk_agent_1,yes of course!,89,4
mturk_agent_2,great!,89,4
mturk_agent_1,So we have agreed i get 2 foods and 3 waters and you get 1 food and 3 firewood? does that sound good?,89,5
mturk_agent_2,I thought you just wanted 2 waters?,89,5
mturk_agent_1,i either need 3 foods and 2 waters or 2 foods and 3 waters.,89,6

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,89,7
mturk_agent_1,How goes the planning of your camping?,890,0
mturk_agent_2,It's going great.  The basic supplies look OK but Im'm concerned if we'll have enough water. My active kids will use a lot.,890,0
mturk_agent_1,We actually were trying to find room to lug our own water and sadly left every drop at home this year.,890,1
mturk_agent_2,"In order for me to feel comfortable on this trip, I would really like to have 2 extra waters.  A couple of extra firewoods would be great also.  How about you?",890,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm sure we can reach an agreement since there are only three to split. There may be a different way to make ends meet.,890,2
mturk_agent_2,"Like I said, I would really like to have 2 waters, 2 firewoods, and a food just in case.  What are your feelings on this?",890,2
mturk_agent_1,"It's not ideal because we need the same supplies, actually. We have a few extra guests coming and we would like to feed them all.",890,3
mturk_agent_2,So exactly what supplies and how many are looking to get?  I told you what I need.,890,3
mturk_agent_1,"Do you have a larger car? Perhaps you could take all the firewood, and I will take all the food.",890,4
mturk_agent_2,I could let you have all the food if I can have all the firewood and 2 waters.🙂,890,4

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,890,5
mturk_agent_1,"hey, I have a huge group of people camping with me, so of priority to me is food and water",891,0
mturk_agent_2,What! That's too bad because i may need all packages of water. I came with kids who like playing with dirt.,891,0
mturk_agent_1,"what about I give you two of the water then, so I take three food and one water and some wood?",891,1
mturk_agent_2,I will need at least one food too.,891,1
mturk_agent_1,"what about I give you all the water, can I have all the food and some wood?",891,2
mturk_agent_2,If that is the case then you can do with one firewood because i need to keep my kids warm. I hope you understand.,891,2
mturk_agent_1,that is fine,891,3
mturk_agent_2,I am not sure though whether the food i have will last.,891,3
mturk_agent_1,"you already have five items and I have four, you still want more?",891,4
mturk_agent_2,It is difficult being me right now. I could use more if it is possible.,891,4
mturk_agent_1,I think that is the best deal I can offer you right now.,891,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,891,5

mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I really need some extra food because I have a large family. Is there anything you really need?",892,1
mturk_agent_2,Honestly? I really need more firewood. I get cold at night and did not bring enough apparently.,892,1
mturk_agent_1,I'm willing to let you take the 3 firewood if you let me have the 3 food.,892,2
mturk_agent_2,I would be happy with that. How are you doing on water? I could use a bit of that myself.,892,2
mturk_agent_1,Would you be okay with taking 1 water? I really need extra because my family and I are going for a hike.,892,3
mturk_agent_2,Any chance you will come across a stream during your hike to fill water bottles? I don't plan to hike so won't have a chance to do any refills.🙂,892,3
mturk_agent_1,You make an excellent point. I should get at least 1 water to be able to last us until we get to a stream.,892,4
mturk_agent_2,I would be happy with that. We can do 3 Firewood for me and 2 water. Then the 3 food for you and 1 water?,892,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,892,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,892,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, how are you?",893,0
mturk_agent_2,"I am good, and you?🙂 We are heading out to camp at Joshua Tree NP.  It is hot in the day, and we will be doing some rockclimbing and hiking.  There is no firewood out there to collect or buy, so I'm hoping to take the firewood and water.",893,0
mturk_agent_1,"That is a bummer since i was hoping for more firewood as well, i am really afraid of wild animals so i will need a big fire",893,1
mturk_agent_2,"😮 Yes, wild animals can be a problem in some locales. I suggest an effective spray and carrying a knife at all times. I am willing to part with one firewood if I can secure the three waters.  Does this work for you?🙂",893,1
mturk_agent_1,"I was really hoping for more firewood and water than that, how about you get two firewoods and two waters and i get the rest of the items? Or the other way around would work as well for me?",893,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, that won't work for me.  Are you able to collect wood where you are camping?  I am afraid that I don't want to budge on the firewood, with one exception.  Without the extra firewood, we would probably need more food that doesn't need to be cooked.  I could give up the two firewood and take three waters and two food.",893,2
mturk_agent_1,"If you will take three waters and two foods that would work for me, that way you get five items to my four.",893,3
mturk_agent_2,"☹️ No, firewood is my highest priority.  If I give up the firewood, I would like all the food and water.  ",893,3
mturk_agent_1,"That would make it 6 to 3 as far as the items go, how about i get 1 firewood and 3 foods, i am taking a loss but that really is as low as i can go",893,4
mturk_agent_2,I can accept that.  ,893,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,893,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,893,5
mturk_agent_2,Hey do you think i can get some more firewood for my camping trip?,894,0
mturk_agent_1,"well, I need it too. How much firewood would you be willing to trade for food?",894,0
mturk_agent_2,i was hoping to get 2 extra firewood and i can give you three wood,894,1
mturk_agent_1,How about I give you 3 firewood for 3 food and 2 water?,894,1
mturk_agent_2,i can give you two food and two water,894,2
mturk_agent_1,we can share. I'll can give you  2 firewood for 3 food and 1 water,894,2
mturk_agent_2,lets go back to your last message i get 3 firewood and 1 water and you get 3 food and 2 water,894,3
mturk_agent_1,that sounds like a good plan.🙂,894,3
mturk_agent_2,then its a deal,894,4
mturk_agent_1,youre a good negotiator 🙂,894,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,894,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,894,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello! 🙂,895,0
mturk_agent_2,Hii,895,0
mturk_agent_1,So I heard we are both camping soon? Do you have an idea of where you are going?,895,1
mturk_agent_2,"Some Interesting Areas are available in our country. So, all places are good and Amazing one",895,1
mturk_agent_1,"sounds great! I'm really excited about my camping trip, I've been looking forward to it. The weather is tricky though",895,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, What are the important things to need for our camp?",895,2
mturk_agent_1,I think durable clothing and tents. Fuel for cooking would be useful,895,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, Now we come to the deal of our camp...",895,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, so I'm going to a place that is hotter during the day and really cold at night. In my case, I would really like to have 2 water, 2 firewood, and 1 food. Is that okay?",895,4
mturk_agent_2,"Sorry, I need a 2 water package, 1 firewood and 1 food because i have a poly urea problem...",895,4
mturk_agent_1,"I'm sorry, I don't know what poly urea is. I have a large group so we really need the extra water and firewood. What if I let you have 1 water, 1 firewood, 2 food? ",895,5
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,895,5
mturk_agent_1,Hi! I'm most interested in water. What are you hoping to get today?,896,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello I'm most interested in the firewood and think we can come to an agreement on the water. ,896,0
mturk_agent_1,"Okay. What if I take all the water and you take the firewood? Then we can split the food, I'll take 2 and you take 1.",896,1
mturk_agent_2,I think it would probably be best if we split it by you getting 2 waters and 1 firewood that way we both have at least one of everything.,896,1
mturk_agent_1,Is there a reason you need extra water above the basic supplies we already have? I have a kidney disorder where I have to drink a ton of water every day.,896,2
mturk_agent_2,Okay if you need the water for that I can go with 3 firewood for me and three waters for you but how much of a priority is food for you?,896,2
mturk_agent_1,It's a pretty big priority but I would be willing to negotiate on it. 🙂,896,3
mturk_agent_2,Since I compromised on the water I think it would be fair for me to get 2 food rations. ,896,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay so I get 3 waters and 1 food, you get 3 firewoods and 2 food?",896,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes I'm okay with that deal.,896,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,896,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,896,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, i am excited to go on this camping trip. Is it okay if i take all the firewood, 2 water and 1 food?",897,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, actually I need some firewood too. Maybe I could have one of the firewood?",897,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, that sounds reasonable, but I really need the firewood because i have a  fear of the dark.",897,1
mturk_agent_2,"I did not bring enough but one more firewood should do. How about I take one firewood, one food, and two water?",897,1
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, okay then. I really need water too, i have a high metabolism so i need to dink lots to stay hydrated. What if I took two firewood, two water and two food?",897,2
mturk_agent_2,How about you take two firewood and all the water and I will take 1 firewood and all the food?,897,2
mturk_agent_1,That's an interesting deal. Is the food what you need most?,897,3
mturk_agent_2,I actually need the firewood the most but can make do with one. I have some but am a little short.,897,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, then i think the deal you mentioned earlier is a good one for us both. Are you still ok with taking 1 firewood and the 3 food, and me everything else?",897,4

mturk_agent_1,Let's try this. What do you need least?,898,1
mturk_agent_2,I need food the least. 🙂 ,898,1
mturk_agent_1,Would you be willing to give me two packages of food?,898,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I am willing to give you two packages of food. ",898,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, I don't really need much water. What do you suggest we do about that?",898,3
mturk_agent_2,I actually needed more water because of my kidney issues. ,898,3
mturk_agent_1,I would be willing to give you two packages of water,898,4
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds good, thank you for giving more packages of water. I really need them. 🙂 ",898,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, now what would you consider to be reasonable for firewood",898,5
mturk_agent_2,I was hoping to get two packages of firewood to have for emergencies. ,898,5
mturk_agent_1,"The thing is, my elderly mum is with us and she would do much better in the evenings with the warmth",898,6
mturk_agent_2,If you give me 3 packages of water I am willing to give you 2 packages of firewood. ,898,6

mturk_agent_1,"YES , I CAN OFFER YOU EXTRA WATER IF YOU PLEASE OFFER ME SOME FIREWOODS IN EXTRA",899,1
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, I'd be okay with taking all the extra water and you could have all the extra firewood. Then we can split up the food.",899,2
mturk_agent_1,GREAT I AM OK WITH THIS DEAL,899,2
mturk_agent_2,"ok, since its an odd amount of each, the food won't be split equally. I'll give you two and me only one.",899,3
mturk_agent_1,ok it is sufficient for me then shall we final this,899,3

mturk_agent_1,I'm also going camping with my two children and 2 of my nephews  How would you like to divide the supplies?,9,1
mturk_agent_2,Well what do you need the most of?,9,2
mturk_agent_1,"I need the most firewood due to a congenital issue that results in us having poor blood circulation to our extremities, thus making them susceptible to frostbite in the cold!",9,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh dear, that sounds serious!  Well I need food the most because my children eat sooo much and I don't think I packed enough.  How about I'll give you all my firewood in exchange for all your food?",9,3
mturk_agent_1,"Would you be down for an arrangement where I get 2 wood, I get 1 food, and 1 water?",9,3

mturk_agent_2,I'm great! and almost done with packing. and exited about the camping too. Waiting to explore and learn during the trip.,90,1
mturk_agent_1,That sounds great! What do you prefer with the additional packages for camping?,90,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yes I do! I was to ask you that in this conversation, will you be Okay with any agreement?",90,2
mturk_agent_1,Let's see what we are both thinking and negotiate from there. What are your first thoughts on the additional camping packages?,90,2
mturk_agent_2,"I need all the food packing and some basic needs for the camping, may I know about your first though on which you need additional package?",90,3
mturk_agent_1,"I will need food packaging as well, so unfortunately I cannot agree on you taking it all. I will need 2 of the food packages, 1 of the firewood, and 2 of the water as I want to ensure to feed/hydrate my family of 5.. Does this work for you?",90,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can't agree to this, as I have to feed my family with 7, so I would be needing 3 food packages and 2 water and 2 firewood. will this be agreed by you?",90,4
mturk_agent_1,"No, that will not work. That does not leave me with hardly anything to feed my family of 5 😮. I will not agree to you taking 3 food packages. I can agree to me taking 2 packages of food, 2 of firewood, and 1 of water.",90,4
mturk_agent_2,In that case I can consider this 2 food packages and 2 water for me and the rest for you. will you agree to this?,90,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, I think I can agree to that! I will take 1 food package, 1 water, and 3 firewood. I can agree to that! 🙂 I hope you have a wonderful time camping!",90,5

mturk_agent_2,"I need water the most, food the least, how bout you?",900,1

mturk_agent_2,I gotcha. We could work out a good deal then ,900,2
mturk_agent_1,Yeah should be easy. My food problem is because my son eats like 5000 calories a day.,900,3
mturk_agent_2,"ooof, growing kids, I know what you are saying!",900,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, so let's see. How about food (2 me 1 you), water (2 you 1 me), and firewood (2 me 1 you)?",900,4

mturk_agent_2,"YEah, good to hear that from you",901,1
mturk_agent_1,"I think that while firewood is very important, I can make a workaround for my needs",901,1
mturk_agent_2,I am someone that needs enough water to survive as well,901,2
mturk_agent_1,So water is the most important to you?,901,2
mturk_agent_2,"It's very important, considering the firewood and food, I should be able to solve myself out.",901,3
mturk_agent_1,OK. I definitely think we can come to a mutually agreeable deal ,901,3

mturk_agent_2,"That sounds so nice, that would really be a memorable moment, we do not need much extra supplies but maybe some extra firewood would be nice since they have never been able to make smores before",902,2
mturk_agent_1,okay! how about you can have all the firewood if i can get 3 waters and 2 foods?,902,2
mturk_agent_2,"that sounds great , we have a fresh water spring nearby so we do not need much water, and one supply of food should be nice as well, that works for me 3 firewood and 1 food, that leaves you with 3 water and 2 food",902,3

mturk_agent_1,🙂I sure am! I'm looking to get a fair bit of food for the trip too. What would you say is important to you?,905,1
mturk_agent_2,Water is definitely the most important for me! I drink more than the average.,905,2
mturk_agent_1,Alirghty then! we should be able to come up with a good deal,905,2
mturk_agent_2,"I agree! How about I take all the water, you take all the food, and we split the firewood? 🙂",905,3
mturk_agent_1,Sounds perfect! It seems like the only question is how we split that firewood up.,905,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can do 1 for me, 2 for you since you got my Star Wars opening! ;)",905,4

mturk_agent_1,"I don't need any of the water, just the firewood and some food.",906,1
mturk_agent_2,Why do you need so much firewood?😮,906,1
mturk_agent_1,I don't have a chainsaw or ax to cut any of my own.☹️,906,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, that would make things difficult!",906,2
mturk_agent_1,I also have some family stopping by for a few hours and it would be rude to not have food for them or a fire for warmth.,906,3
mturk_agent_2,I see.  So I get 3 waters and 1 food under your offer?,906,3
mturk_agent_1,That's right.,906,4

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,906,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello there! :) I was thinking that I could take 3 water and two food packages, and you could have all the rest of the items. Does that sound okay to you?",907,0
mturk_agent_1,I really would like to have some extra water. We will be hiking and I think that we will need some extra water.,907,0
mturk_agent_2,"Would you prefer that I take 2 waters and all three foods, and you can have all the rest? That way, we both have extra water, I can address my dehydration issues from a recent illness, and we both have what we need.",907,1
mturk_agent_1,"If you take two waters, then it is fair that I take 2 of the food and 2 firewood.",907,1
mturk_agent_2,I have really bad eyesight and there are bears and mountain lions in these woods. I would need at least two firewoods or I'll probably get eaten alive. LOL 🙂,907,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I am going to be somewhere where it gets cold at night, so I will need it for the warmth. We will have small children with us.",907,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, in that case, I can yield on the firewood. How about this? I take two waters, two foods, and you can have ALL of the firewood and one food and one water?",907,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about you take 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood?",907,3
mturk_agent_2,"Are you sure you don't want all the firewood? I can always try to find a brighter place to camp, but you have small children, so you'll need the extra wood to keep the war, comfortable, and protected from wild animals. I could take two waters, two foods, and none of the wood, so you'd have ALL the wood for yourself, as previously offered. 🙂",907,4
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, that is fine. I'll take 1 water, 1 food, and 3 firewood.",907,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,907,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,907,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello i would like to trade you for some firewood please.,908,0
mturk_agent_1,"Ok! I'm super excited to be camping soon with my family! We're planning to camp out on the beach and will have limited access to the freshwater pipes there. But we plan to do a lot of fishing, it will be fun! What do you plan to be doing with the firewood?",908,0
mturk_agent_2,Sounds really fun! I will be cooking food for my family and making lots of smore's and of course singing songs around the campfire. But you can't have a campfire without firewood!,908,1
mturk_agent_1,"That's true, smores over a butane stove doesn't quite make as fun memories as over a campfire.",908,1
mturk_agent_2,haha they don't thats for sure. Nothing quite like the crackling of a fire and the smell of smoke. What kind of fish are you hoping to catch?,908,2
mturk_agent_1,"We're not 100% sure since there's all kinds of fish where we're going. My husband also wants to try crab and lobster catching too. It'll be a great way for my son to get out of the house. He's driving me crazy, with all of us cooped up due to Covid",908,2
mturk_agent_2,"oh wow that does sound great! Ya i bet, i am also going crazy cooped up in the house with my three younger siblings",908,3
mturk_agent_1,"So far, I've packed a lot of water, but with how active my son and husband are, I'm not sure if its enough. They plan to be doing a lot of swimming, fishing, and playing in the sand. The weather forecast is also looking like its going to be really hot. How's your planning coming along? Are you only in need of firewood?",908,3
mturk_agent_2,Don't want them getting dehydrated for sure! Thats a sure fire way to ruin a camping trip. My plan is coming along well thanks for asking! I need a little bit of water and a little bit of food as well. We are planning to go hiking near a mountain so during the days we  will be gone on the trails and will need to bring a bit of food and water with us,908,4
mturk_agent_1,"That's nice! I know we're planning to cook whatever fish we catch (because its always tastier when you've grown/caught it yourself). We're planning to bring a butane stove with us but we were thinking of making a campfire for one of the days so that my son gets the experience. Idk, do you think beach driftwood would cut it?",908,4
mturk_agent_2,"Wouldn't be quite the same for sure, there is nothing quite like an authentic campfire",908,5

mturk_agent_1,hi,909,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello! 🙂 Are you ready to go camping?,909,0
mturk_agent_1,I am. It's really hot here,909,1
mturk_agent_2,Make sure to stay hydrated! It is hot.,909,1
mturk_agent_1,Have you given any thought to what supplies you would need?,909,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I have. I made a list, but I definitely need to trade a few things. How about you? 🙂",909,2
mturk_agent_1,I have. My biggest need is firewood because we are going to have a pretty large group and need to keep the campsite lit as much as possible,909,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can help you with that if you can help me with food! I usually try to find food in the woods, but I'd like to take a break from that this trip.",909,3
mturk_agent_1,That works for me. How does this proposal sound--- I'll take 2 or 3 of the firewood (I don't know if you need any or can get by without it) You can have 2 or 3 of the food (If I only have 2 firewood I'll probably need 1 package of food) and we can split the water however.,909,4
mturk_agent_2,"That's fair to me. I can give you all 3 of the firewood for 3 foods. I can take 2 waters, unless you need 2. 🙂🙂",909,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,909,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,909,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I am a mother of two and I have two kids who need extra food and water,91,0
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I need food and water too unfortunately. We can discuss this.🙂",91,0
mturk_agent_2,"Alright... my baby is on formula and needs water for her bottles. My son snacks all day and really needs food. Otherwise, he will starve and won't thrive",91,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, maybe wwe can split the food and water somehow. I don't know how.🙂",91,1
mturk_agent_2,"Can i have 2 firewood, 2 food and 1 water",91,2
mturk_agent_1,That can work. That seems like a good solution to the problem.🙂,91,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok I hope you are okay with that. Please confirm!,91,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I will confirm that. Thanks! 🙂",91,3
mturk_agent_2,That is great! it was so easy to work with you,91,4

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,91,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I think I have enough firewood already so I am willing to give you all of the firewood if you give me more of the food or water.",910,0
mturk_agent_1,I also think I have enough firewood. I would trade you two fire wood for 1 water,910,0
mturk_agent_2,"That sounds fair.  If I do that, then would you be willing to let me have 2 packages of food? ",910,1
mturk_agent_1,I will give two packages of food  i nstead of 1 water .,910,1
mturk_agent_2,"So how does this sound....I get 2 packages of food, 1 package of water, and 1 package of firewood?  I have five children with me on this trip so I am the most concerned about nobody getting too hungry!  🙂",910,2
mturk_agent_1,No. You give me 3 packages of firewood.and I give you  2 packages of food and 1 water.,910,2
mturk_agent_2,I think that would work.  Do you really think you need all three packages of firewood though?  If you said you already had enough firewood then why take all three? ☹️,910,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes i think it's fair. I need food and water yet I am parting with 2 packages of food and 1 water. Just trying to be fair and help you our since you have extra people with you. You can find firewood in the wild if need be.,910,3
mturk_agent_2,"That is true, I appreciate the tip.  Hopefully it will be dry enough to use in the fire.  ",910,4
mturk_agent_1,Is it final then?,910,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes that sounds good to me!  Enjoy your camping trip.  🙂,910,5

mturk_agent_2,"I have plenty of water, and unfortunately it is cold where I am at as well, I also need it for cooking.",911,1
mturk_agent_1,seems we have similar needs - how would you feel about you getting 2 firewood (highest opriority) and 1 water and 1 food,911,1
mturk_agent_2,I will take the 2 firewood and 1 food but would like 2 water. ,911,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think thats pretty reasonable, i should be able to camp comfortably with that setup",911,2
mturk_agent_2,I think we both can be comfortable with it. ,911,3
mturk_agent_1,"So that will leave me 1 firewood, 2 food, 1 water",911,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, and we should both have enough to camp.",911,4

mturk_agent_1,Absolutely! The kids are really looking forward to it,912,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, as are mine. Speaking of which, they really enjoy campfires and staying up late, would you mind if I were to get 2 extra firewood?",912,1
mturk_agent_1,Well my kids are really looking to telling ghost stories by the campfire. They're going to be disappointed if I am only going to get 1 firewood. What else do you need?,912,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, a lot of extra water would be great then since it will be hot where I'm going. If you are getting two extra firewood, I would want all the water.",912,2
mturk_agent_1,"Then my kids won't have anything to drink. If you want 2 firewood, that's fine with me but I think it is only fair that I get 2 water and 2 food. What do you think?",912,2
mturk_agent_2,"So I would get 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food?",912,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes,912,3
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good to me,912,4
mturk_agent_1,"Ok great, I'll send over a proposal shortly",912,4

mturk_agent_2,I am very excited and just about ready to go on the big trip.,913,0
mturk_agent_1,"Very nice, I would definitely like to have a bigger, longer campfire, helps with food and fun. Would you mind if I took extra firewood? I could do without any extra food.",913,1
mturk_agent_2,I was looking for extra firewood as well as I have brought along 2 more people than normally planned.  So I will be cooking more at mealtime and for a longer duration.  I will not need as much water.  Could I interest you in extra water?,913,1
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, extra water would be good too, would still need some firewood though. I could get by with 1 firewood if I could use 3 extra water, how does that sound?",913,2
mturk_agent_2,The firewood deals sounds good if I am able to get 2 packages.  However not sure if I can pass on all the extra waters.,913,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, so how about I get 1 firewood, 2 waters and 2 food. You would get 2 firewood, 1 food and 1 water.",913,3
mturk_agent_2,"The problem is with the extra people I brought I'm going to have to figure out a good deal with the food as well.  I'm thinking me 3 firewood, 0 water, and 2 food.  Leaves you with 0 firewood, 3 waters and 1 food",913,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, I'd rather have more water than food. I have people I need to think about too. I think the best I can do was my previous offer.",913,4
mturk_agent_2,OK so let's settle each item.  Can we say we agree on I get 2 firewood and you get 1?,913,4
mturk_agent_1,"yes, thats fine. Please remember though that my top preference was to have as much firewood as possible and you are getting more now.",913,5
mturk_agent_2,You also said you could get by with 1 firewood if you could get 3 waters.  Does that sound good on those two items?,913,5
mturk_agent_1,"sure, with that, i would be good with only getting 1 extra food, you could have the other 2.",913,6
mturk_agent_2,Are you sure?  That's seems pretty generous of you!,913,6
mturk_agent_1,"Well, that would be 1 firewood, 3 waters and 1 food for me. I'll gladly take 2 food if you don't need it, but I'm fine with 1.",913,7
mturk_agent_2,Anyway you would be willing to give up 1 of the waters?,913,7
mturk_agent_1,"We already agreed on the wood and water, do you want 1 food or two?",913,8
mturk_agent_2,Ok so settled that I get 2 firewood and no water right.,913,8
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,913,9
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,913,9
mturk_agent_2,I don't think we exactly resolved the food issue.  I was telling you I had extra people with me anyway I can get 2 foods?,913,10
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, thats fine, so that leaves me with 1 firewood, 3 water, 1 food. Good?",913,10

mturk_agent_2,i cannot sorry,914,2
mturk_agent_1,Why not? ,914,3
mturk_agent_2,I need 3 food if i give 3 wood,914,3

mturk_agent_2,"I actually forgot one of my coolers at home, so I am a bit low on food, too. I could spare some water if you could spare some food.",915,0
mturk_agent_1,I could give you 2 packages of water if you could give me 2 packages of food 🙂,915,1
mturk_agent_2,"Hmmm, that is tempting, but I don't really need water. I would have trouble sparing food, but I might be able to spare 1 package for a couple packages of firewood. 🙂",915,1
mturk_agent_1,So you would give me 1 package of food for 2 packages of firewood?,915,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think I could do that. If you give me the 2 packages of firewood, I might need some extra water to put out my fire the next day, though, so could I have 2 packages of water, also?",915,2
mturk_agent_1,So you want 2 packages of everything?  That won't leave me with enough supplies.,915,3
mturk_agent_2,"I think that the food is quite valuable, though, that is why I am willing to give 1 package in exchange for 2 firewoods and 2 waters. Do you have something else in mind? 🙂",915,3
mturk_agent_1,I'm not sure I understand what you are proposing...can you clarify?,915,4
mturk_agent_2,"I mean that I am okay with you having 2 packages of food, if I can have 2 packages of firewood and 2 packages of water.",915,4

mturk_agent_1,The forecast looks clear from what I've seen. We are planning to build a big fire and learn to cook over it!,916,1
mturk_agent_2,That is always a lot of fun I do love teaching kids something new about survival ,916,1
mturk_agent_1,"They really enjoy earning badges, and it's great to pass on new skills. Would you find if we take some extra food and firewood for our project?",916,2
mturk_agent_2,I wouldn't mind giving you the extra firewood. I would love to have some extra food as well,916,2
mturk_agent_1,I've got plenty of water. I wouldn't mind giving you a food and some water if I can get the firewood.,916,3
mturk_agent_2,I have no issues with that at all. Beings you will be teaching them about cooking over the fire it would be more beneficial for you to have extra. ,916,3
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds good. So you get 1 food and all water, and I'll keep firewood and 2 food.",916,4

mturk_agent_1,I am ready. However i have some issues i may need all the water available.,917,1
mturk_agent_2,"I too need water, but am willing to make a sacrifice for some extra firewood and food. I'll gladly give you 2 water, in exchange for me having 2 firewood and 2 food and you can have 1 firewood, and 1 food",917,1
mturk_agent_1,Don't you think it will be unfair? I also need extra firewood. Will you give up one?,917,2
mturk_agent_2,"It will be hard for me to give up that much, how about 1 food instead?",917,2
mturk_agent_1,That will be better. What is your top priority?,917,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, like I said, water is important, as I'll be hiking a lot, but again, how does this sound? For me: 1 water, 2 firewood, 1 food. For you: 2 water, 1 firewood, 2 food",917,3
mturk_agent_1,I think i will accept that. I could have wished for more but it looks impossible.,917,4
mturk_agent_2,"Great! Here, you submit the deal, and I'll accept it. I think this'll be good for both of us, we have to figure out who gets the extra one, as someone gets 5 and someone gets 4, as there's 9 items",917,4

mturk_agent_1,These will be helpful for my trip. How about I take 2 and you can have 1? I will give you a good deal on another product if you accept. ,918,1
mturk_agent_2,"It has rained a lot in the area I will be going to, so the availability of dry wood to scavenge for will be difficult. Do you know of any techniques to dry out wet wood?",918,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, you can place it in the sun during the daytime hours. Should work. ",918,2
mturk_agent_2,That makes sense. What is your need for food?,918,3
mturk_agent_1,I don't need much. How about you take 2 and I have 1?,918,3
mturk_agent_2,"That would be very helpful! Because due to the high amount of rains I believe the poisonous mushrooms will be thick, so to be safe I think having extra food would be wise.",918,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I believe that is good. Now how about your need for water?",918,4
mturk_agent_2,I would be willing to give you 2 and I take 1. There is plenty of rain water to collect and a spring nearby.,918,5
mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, I am going to need a lot of water. It has been really dry here. Can you collect a bit more water and give me 2 so I am not too thirsty while camping?",918,5

mturk_agent_1,Understood. What about food? Do you feel like you are set in that area?,919,2
mturk_agent_2,"i have some food and i think it should last , but one can never bee to careful.",919,3
mturk_agent_1,"How about I get 2 waters, 1 firewood, and 2 food?",919,3
mturk_agent_2,i can spare some food but I am really low on water. how about you take 2 food 2 firewood and 1 water and i take 2 water one food and 1 firewood?,919,4

mturk_agent_2,I would like 2 of the firewood. What do you think? ,92,3
mturk_agent_1,I don't need wood as I am usually warm so I think we can work out a deal. I like to have more water and I usually get thirsty.,92,4
mturk_agent_2,That sounds good to me. 🙂 I think we can make a good deal.,92,4
mturk_agent_1,I can give you 3 wood packages if I can get 3 water and 2 food. So you will receive 3 wood and 1 food. What do you think?,92,5

mturk_agent_2,"I understand. However, I need at least 1 extra firewood because I have a very flimsy tent which isn't warm. I'm also pregnant",920,1
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I can give you 1 firewood.  I also need water because I have high blood pressure and if I don't drink enough fluids I am at high risk for having a stroke",920,1
mturk_agent_2,"okay, however I need a lot of extra water because I have a medical condition that causes me to dehydrate easily",920,2
mturk_agent_1,"I guess we both are sick people stuck on this camping trip, eh? 🙂",920,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm happy to be on the trip. I think with some of these extra things it will be easier. Do you need any extra food?,920,3
mturk_agent_1,"I could use 2 food, it would go a long way in feeding the children in my group.  would you go with 2 wood for me, 1 water for me, and 2 food for me?",920,3

mturk_agent_1,"If something goes wrong on the camping trip and I get stranded, it seems by far the most useful thing to have around.",921,1
mturk_agent_2,I understand. I have a need for water too along with firewood. ,921,1
mturk_agent_1,Okay me too. Is there any reason you would need more food?,921,2
mturk_agent_2,"I don't need more food, I have a specific diet I must follow so I bought plenty of food. I would like 2 water and 2 firewood. What do you think about that?",921,2
mturk_agent_1,"That doesn't seem like a great deal to me because I'm left with only 1 water and 1 firewood. What if you get 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food; I get 1 water, 2 firewood, 2 food?",921,3

At the last minute my teenage son decided to bring a couple of buddy's along on the trip and I didnt pack enough food. I thought they could go fishing and catch more food but they havent been able to catch a single fish. I would also need a little extra water as well. How are you doing with your supplies.",922,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, we'll we will see about that. I really need firewood most and foremost.",922,0
mturk_agent_2,that sounds pretty good. We did bring a propane grill for cooking so I can spare some extra firewood. ,922,1
mturk_agent_1,Thats awesome! Looking forward to working out a deal for you.,922,1
mturk_agent_2,If you will give me three food packages I will give you three firewood bundles and we just need to work out the water,922,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds great to me. I would love that idea. How badly do you need water?,922,2
mturk_agent_2,Well I did pack some other juices and sodas so I would be willing to compromise on water,922,3
mturk_agent_1,"Sounds great. If I could have 2, that would be great.",922,3

mturk_agent_1,"Yea, but that's why I only want 1 of everything else. That leaves you 2 of everything except the firewood. That sounds pretty fair to me.",925,8
mturk_agent_2,"if you need all, then make firewood 1 to you then it will balance, if u take one water from me its not equalize,",925,9
mturk_agent_1,"You would be getting 5 items, and I'm only getting 4. That's pretty balanced. ",925,9

mturk_agent_1,"Okay, how about I get the firewood and one water, you get 2 waters and one food?",927,3
mturk_agent_2,how about i get 2 waters and 2 foods. you get all the firewood and 1 food and 1 water.  that way the kids can stay hydrated and fed in the desert and you can have firewood to keep you warm with your health condition and some food and water too.,927,3

mturk_agent_2,"Perfect! What would you think about if we divided it up so you could have all 3 firewood then, and we could split water and food? ",928,1
mturk_agent_1,"Would you be willing to give me 3 firewood, I'll give you 3 water or food, which ever you need more and we split the rest. What do you say?",928,1
mturk_agent_2,"We could work that out, to keep it even I'll give you the firewood, you can take all 3, and I can take 3 of one of my lower items, food. Then split water?",928,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, so I'll take 3 firewood, you take 3 food and then how about you take 2 water and I'll take 1. Is that fair?",928,2
mturk_agent_2,That would be the fairest option I think! ,928,3

mturk_agent_2,That isn't cool by me. I need the food as well. It's very important to me and my family. How about I take 2 food and 3 firewood. You can take all the water,929,2
mturk_agent_1,"You can have all the firewood, but I really would like 2 food.  My children are going to need plenty of energy if they are going to go hiking.",929,3
mturk_agent_2,"The food is important to me as well. Since you ain't ready to allow me take 2 food, you will have to sacrifice some water then. I take 1 food, 3 firewood and 2 water. You can take the 2 food and 1 water since you won't be needing any firewood",929,3

mturk_agent_1,"I need at least one ration of food.  Would it be ok with me:  3 firewood and 1 each of food and water.  If you are ok with that, I am too.",93,2

mturk_agent_1,"I might be able to get you 3 packages of water, if you allow me to have three packages of food.",930,1
mturk_agent_2,"OK..🙂! That's fine because I don't eat a lot and can ration what I have this is alright with me, friend.",930,2
mturk_agent_1,I also need 2 packages of fire wood because my body doesn't regulate temperature well and the evenings can be quite cold. ,930,2
mturk_agent_2,"No, problem about the Firewood, because I don't get cold easily!🙂. I don't mind if you need 2 packages of firewood.",930,3
mturk_agent_1,You are very generous. Thank you my friend! 🙂  The firewood will be used to heat up my baby's formula. ,930,3

mturk_agent_2,"water is my top priority too. Its health reasons, but I say what about 2 waters",931,1
mturk_agent_1,"I could live with only getting one water, but only if I got 2 packages of firewood and 3 packages of food.",931,2
mturk_agent_2, all of the food? what about 1 water 2 firewood and then 2 packages of 2 food,931,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think that work work.  So you would get 2 water, 1 firewood, 1 food.  I would get 1 water, 2 firewood, 2 food, correct?",931,3
mturk_agent_2,yeah that seems to be a little bit better. the other one would have one of us going without a backup for an emergency. ,931,3
mturk_agent_1,Makes sense.  Thank you.,931,4
mturk_agent_2,"okay, so then what are you finally agreeing to?",931,4

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,931,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello there! I am in need of additional water due to my health condition,932,0
mturk_agent_1,What kind of health condition?  We both require water to make it thru the camping trip,932,0
mturk_agent_2,"Due to my blood pressure medicaton, I need to stay hydrated at all times. It is more important for me to drink rather than eat which is why I would give you more food in exchange for more water for me",932,1
mturk_agent_1,That is understandable but if you were to get the majority of the water I would want all the firewood and 2 packages of food ,932,1
mturk_agent_2,I am happy to give you 2 packs of food and the lions share of the firewood but I think I need 1 firewood. I am not a good firestarter,932,2
mturk_agent_1,So are you ok with me getting 1 package of water and 2 firewood and 2 food,932,2
mturk_agent_2,I am absolutely OK with that deal.,932,3
mturk_agent_1,Just need to make sure we are both have sufficient supplies because I dont know about you but living off the land would probably be disastrous for me,932,3
mturk_agent_2,I appreciate your concern. I did bring a little bit of emergency food,932,4
mturk_agent_1,I think we have struck a deal then.  Unless there is anything else to be discussed I think we can conclude the negotiation ,932,4

mturk_agent_2,We do need a lot of water because we need to go to the top to looking for this herb and some food for get us energy to the top.,933,1
mturk_agent_1,"I am also in need of a lot of water for my trip.  It is in the hot, dry season so I may not have much for streams to try and boil water down that is safe to drink from.  I will also need some extra food due to the animals in the area maybe not being abundant.  I would be willing to cut my trip a day short since you need water more than I do. But could I then have a bit more food?",933,2
mturk_agent_2,"I understand and would like to share some supplies with you. Do you mind if I take 2 water, 2 food and 1 firewood and you will have 2 firewood, 2 food and 2 water?",933,2
mturk_agent_1,I would be willing to give up all my firewood for 2 of the food.  I would take 1 of the water then.  I will have an abundance of firewood in the area to scavenge for so I really do not have any need for firewood.,933,3
mturk_agent_2,"So you will have 2 food, 1 water and I will have 1 food, 2 water and 3 firewood. Is it correct?",933,3

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,933,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hi.   Let's see how we can best divide up the extra supplies.   I am thinking that I really could use extra wood.  So how about I take 2 woods, an extra food, and 2 waters?",934,0
mturk_agent_2,Hold up buddy😮 You come out without even asking my preferences or needs? What are you a millenial?,934,0
mturk_agent_1,"Absolutely not.  I'm an old lady. LOL.  Of course,  we need to discuss your preferences and needs.  I just like to be forthright and get things rolling.  What are you thinking that you can use?",934,1
mturk_agent_2,"Lol okay. No biggie. I am have a large family of 5  with 3 being kids and we are camping in the mountains this weekend. I sure could use most of the firewood for us to keep warm at night, I have poor blood circulation and kind of need it so I can function. The water is not a big deal to me. We can melt the snow for extra drinking water and boil it if need be. I would like one extra food too.",934,1
mturk_agent_1,"I can relate to the need to keep warm at night!  Arthritis aches bad when I'm chilly.  It will be cold in the mountains for sure.  I can see you need extra.  How about you take 2?  I'm good on food so you can have what you need of that. Water would me nice.  If you can make do, I'd like at least 2 waters.",934,2
mturk_agent_2,"That would work perfectly for us. I will take the 2 wood, 1 water and 3 food? Do you want a food?",934,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, please. A food would be great.  ",934,3
mturk_agent_2,🙂 That will work for us. Thank you. You can have a food.,934,3

mturk_agent_1,"oh, I'm sorry to hear about that... I think I can help with the water, but you need firewood as well?",938,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, just one would be beneficial.  I don't regulate my body heat as much as I used to.",938,2
mturk_agent_1,"The reason I am asking, is because it gets very cold in the desert at night...and I may need that... but if all you need is one, I don't see why we couldn't make a deal",938,3
mturk_agent_2,that would be amazing - I know it does get cold so I definitely don't want you to be cold either.  I don't need any of the food - not much of an appetite right now anyway.,938,3
mturk_agent_1,"Once again, really sad to hear about your condition☹️..., but perhaps being in the great outdoors would be beneficial for your immune system?😮... So you need 3 water and 1 firewood?",938,4
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that would be great for me - would that work for you?",938,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yep, I mostly need the firewood, but I can do with 2 packages... So let's make it happen!🙂",938,5

mturk_agent_2,Hi. I hope you are enjoying the camping trip.,939,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi 🙂 So far I am! What about you?,939,0
mturk_agent_2,I am doing great only that i need to add a few items.,939,1
mturk_agent_1,Same here! Which item(s) are most important to you?,939,1
mturk_agent_2,Food is the most important. I will not give it up for anything. What about you?,939,2
mturk_agent_1,"I could use food, too. However, I'd consider giving up some food in exchange for other items. I could probably spread out my food ration if I got more of other items.",939,2
mturk_agent_2,"Okay then . Let me present you my offer. I take 3 food, 2 firewood and 1 water.",939,3
mturk_agent_1,"Wow, that's really not a good deal ☹️ If you get all the food then I would request 3 firewood and 3 water to even it out. Food is most important to both of us.",939,3
mturk_agent_2,I think it is a good deal. ,939,4
mturk_agent_1,It isn't. You're getting more items and all 3 of the highest value items. I would walk away rather than taking that deal.,939,4
mturk_agent_2,What do you propose? Walking away is not really a good thing. I believe we can agree.,939,5

mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,939,8
mturk_agent_2,I really need the firewood. Please be kind to me.,939,8
mturk_agent_1,"I need the firewood as well. You're getting more of our highest items, so I get more items overall. You get all 3 food, but I get 5 items and you get 4. It's the fairest deal. I am not going to be ripped off and will walk away if need be.",939,9
mturk_agent_2,You haven't changed your deal at all. Is that how we negotiate?,939,9
mturk_agent_1,I've offered you my fairest deal. I can make one change and that would be I get one food given to me and I'll give you one firewood. ,939,10

mturk_agent_2,How are you enjoying the camping trip so far?,94,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi. It’s great, but very cold here. How about you? ",94,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes the cold is hard to adjust to I can't seem to shake the chill.,94,1
mturk_agent_1,I could really use some extra firewood!,94,1
mturk_agent_2,So could I. How about we split the firewood?,94,2
mturk_agent_1,How about I take 2 firewood but you can have 2 waters? Water is pretty important and I have a little extra.,94,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds fair.,94,3
mturk_agent_1,How are you on food? ,94,3
mturk_agent_2,I need extra food. I have recently  been ill and my doctor has prescribed extra calories so I can regain my strength.,94,4
mturk_agent_1,I’m sorry to hear that! If there are 3 packages of food please take 2 of them. I could stand to eat less!,94,4
mturk_agent_2,Thank you. That deal is perfect!🙂,94,5
mturk_agent_1,Sounds good to me. Let me see how to execute this trade!,94,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,94,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,94,6
mturk_agent_2,Hi! I am really hungry! How are you liking camping?,940,0
mturk_agent_1,I love it.  But I would like to build a fire so I need some firewood.,940,0
mturk_agent_2,Really? I have a lot of firewood!,940,1
mturk_agent_1,How many are you willing to part with?,940,1
mturk_agent_2,I’d be willing to trade you 2 firewood’s for 2 food packages if you want,940,2
mturk_agent_1,That sounds like a great deal to me.,940,2
mturk_agent_2,How are you on water?,940,3
mturk_agent_1,I am okay on water.  What about you?,940,3
mturk_agent_2,"I’m ok on water, middle of the road as well. Willing to share if you like.",940,4
mturk_agent_1,I'll take one water if that's okay.,940,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,940,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,940,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hey, I was thinking that I would get 2 firewood and you can have 2 food and 2 water. What do you think?",941,0
mturk_agent_2,lets talk about it. why do you need two firewood? ,941,0
mturk_agent_1,I'll be camping with my young kids and I want to make sure that we are warm enough in case it's colder than expected.,941,1
mturk_agent_2,thats a valid point - i suppose kids do need more warmth,941,1
mturk_agent_1,Would you be ok with taking the extra food and water?,941,2
mturk_agent_2,yes I think that would be a workable solution. i like your compromise. ,941,2
mturk_agent_1,"Awesome, I think that's fair to both of us. Do you want to go over anything else?",941,3
mturk_agent_2,I think that maybe we ought to talk a bit more - I know we cant do a deal yet. ,941,3
mturk_agent_1,I'm glad we are close to a compromise. I think we can both benefit and have a good camping trip.,941,4
mturk_agent_2,absolutely - it will be a great camping experience for us all,941,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,941,5

mturk_agent_2,Hi,942,0

mturk_agent_2,"Good, really hot here!",942,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, went for a run and using up my water faster than I expected.",942,1
mturk_agent_2,So we're going camping. Any idea how'd you'd like to split up the provisions?,942,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, perhaps I could have 2 of the waters, you could have 2 of the food items, and really don't care about the firewood, you could have it all. What do you think?",942,2
mturk_agent_2,"Actually that sounds fine to me. So to review, you get 2 waters and 2 food. I get 3 firewood, 1 water and 1 food. Sound right?",942,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, that's what seems like it should work. Unless you have a better idea.",942,3
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,942,4
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,942,4
mturk_agent_1,hello,943,0

mturk_agent_1,Yeah sure. Hope you have all the supplies you need.,943,2
mturk_agent_2,"You too, what would your trip successful?",943,2
mturk_agent_1,We're planning on going on hiking tomorrow morning so maybe we'll need some more water..could you please help me withh that?,943,3
mturk_agent_2,I require immense amounts of water to survive.  I am afraid that is prerequisite if are to make any progress.,943,3
mturk_agent_1,I have some extra firewood if you want. 🙂,943,4
mturk_agent_2,"Firewood to me is hit or miss, I would be willing to give up food however. 🙂",943,4
mturk_agent_1,sure that would work too !,943,5
mturk_agent_2,"Alright then, I propose this.",943,5
mturk_agent_1,What do you want in return?,943,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,943,6

mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,943,8
mturk_agent_1,Reject-Deal,943,8
mturk_agent_1,how about we equally divide everything,943,9
mturk_agent_2,It is quite frankly impossible to equally divide 9 items.,943,9
mturk_agent_1,you can keep some extra firewood,943,10
mturk_agent_2,"Apparently you are stuck on water, I require mass quantities of water.  Anything less than 2 is unacceptable to me.",943,10
mturk_agent_1,yeah same here friend ☹️,943,11
mturk_agent_2,"So here is my final proposal, this is the best deal I will offer.  ",943,11

mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,943,14
mturk_agent_1,Hello!  I am getting ready to go on a camping trip and will need some extra supplies.  Are you also going camping or hiking?,944,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes I am going camping and hiking and would like to procure some additional provisions,944,0
mturk_agent_1,Fantastic!  It's really cold where I'm going to be camping at night.  ,944,1
mturk_agent_2,"Wow, hopefully you have the proper weight sleeping bag. I’m planning on doing a lot of hiking and it’s very warm where I’m going. It sounds like you need more firewood than I do. ",944,1
mturk_agent_1,I could use 2 packages of firewood.  That would be great if you could spare it. I can make it up to you with some extra water or food.,944,2
mturk_agent_2,I actually feel comfortable with allotting 2 firewood packages to you but I would like to secure 2 waters  because of all the physical  exertion from hiking and the ☀️ ,944,2
mturk_agent_1,Thank you!  I more than happy to let you have the 2 waters.  You are probably going to get pretty hungry from all of that hiking.,944,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes come to think of it, power bars are really helpful but I don’t want to seem greedy taking additional food",944,3
mturk_agent_1,Ok.  Do you mind if I take 2 packages of food? That will give us something to do if it rains when I'm camping.,944,4
mturk_agent_2,I’d rather give you more firewood quite honestly ,944,4
mturk_agent_1,Ok.  How about you take the 2 packages of food then and we'll have a deal.,944,5
mturk_agent_2,So I’m thinking you take all the firewood bc I am taking our sprinter camping van and then I’ll take two water and two food packages,944,5
mturk_agent_1,You want me to take all 3 of the firewood?  That's mighty kind of you.  Sounds like we have a deal.,944,6
mturk_agent_2,"Yes,so how do we submit it?  ",944,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,944,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,944,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, How are you?",945,0
mturk_agent_2,Great how are you?! 🙂,945,0
mturk_agent_1,Doing well. So what do you think is the most important for your trip? ,945,1
mturk_agent_2,Firewood and water are most important. We're planning on taking an over night hike so we'll need the supplies to take with us to make a fire at the end of the evening. The temperatuers are also higher than normal so we need to make sure we're hydrated.,945,1
mturk_agent_1,"Since the temperatures are higher, do you think you'd have a fire running all the time or all that often outside of cooking food? ",945,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm thinking a fire to keep the bugs away and to cook dinner. The smoke will allow us to be more comfortable and less likely to get bitten by bugs.,945,2
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, I can understand that. I think for me, our location has temperatures that drop quite a bit at night so we would need it as a heat source. There really isn't an option for us to sleep without a fire going all night",945,3
mturk_agent_2,"So could I do: 1 firewood, all the water and 2 food?",945,3
mturk_agent_1,I could agree to that. We are near a water source so we could sanitize water if we needed it,945,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, that would work for me then. We are in agreeance? ",945,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,945,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,945,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello,946,0
mturk_agent_1,hii,946,0
mturk_agent_2,Im running low on food☹️ are you willing to provide 1 food and i can offer you 1 water ,946,1
mturk_agent_1,"i can do that, can i have three water then",946,1
mturk_agent_2,How about I give you 2 waters and you give me an additional firewood,946,2
mturk_agent_1,you can have all the firewood if you offer me 3 water,946,2
mturk_agent_2,hmm okay I can work with that so I'll give you 3 waters and I get 3 Firewood,946,3
mturk_agent_1,sounds good!,946,3
mturk_agent_2,so we can keep the food then,946,4
mturk_agent_1,we should split the food i guess,946,4
mturk_agent_2,"hmm  how would we split it you get 1 and I get 1, how does that sound",946,5
mturk_agent_1,that is good!,946,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,946,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,946,6
mturk_agent_1,"How are you? this is embarrassing but my water somehow leaked, any chance you can spare some of yours?",947,0
mturk_agent_2,i may be able to spare some. do you have any extra firewood?,947,0
mturk_agent_1,"I do. I could gave you 2 of my wood for 3 water. Although I kind of also need food, found a small puppy so kind of need a little extra food.",947,1
mturk_agent_2,i can't spare all three of the water. What if I give you one water?,947,1
mturk_agent_1,"i could give you 3 of my firewood if you can do 2 water and 2 food, would that work?",947,2
mturk_agent_2,could we do it where I give you 1 water and 2 food? ,947,2
mturk_agent_1,"I would you take all 3 firewood, for 2 water 1 food instead?",947,3
mturk_agent_2,"so just to clarify, I would take all 3 firewood, and then I keep 1 water and 2 food? And you'd get 2 water and 1 food?",947,3
mturk_agent_1,yes that is correct . Sound like a deal?,947,4
mturk_agent_2,"let me check one other thing - I really do need the water to stay hydrated. What if I only keep 2 firewood, and give you one firewood, 1 water, and 2 food?",947,4
mturk_agent_1,"i do not need any fire wood but the other things I really need are water the most, since mine leaked. And food since I found a puppy and plan to share mine either way, but would be nice to have more.",947,5
mturk_agent_2,"i guess we can do it where i keep all the firewood, and i give you 2 water and 1 food.",947,5
mturk_agent_1,"that would be amazing!, hank you so much",947,6
mturk_agent_2,you're welcome.,947,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,947,7
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,947,7
mturk_agent_2,What are your highest priority items?,948,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I could really use additional packages of food.",948,0
mturk_agent_2,Nice I could really use some firewood! I'd be willing to give you all the food if I could get most of the water and firewood. ,948,1
mturk_agent_1,"I could definitely give you all 3 bundles of firewood, in exchange for 3 packages of food. I would be willing to give you 2 water, if you can give me 1",948,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes that sounds like a good deal for all parties. I will send the offer when it's available. ,948,2
mturk_agent_1,"Ok, looks like we need to hit a couple more back and forth conversations before it is available to submit. Do you want to just confirm what you will be entering for your deal?",948,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ya sounds good. I will get three firewood, two water and zero food. You will get zero firewood, 1 water, and three food. ",948,3
mturk_agent_1,That's perfect. I have no complaints about the deal,948,3
mturk_agent_2,How are you doing this fine day.🙂,948,4
mturk_agent_1,"Doing great, thanks for asking! I'll go ahead and submit the deal as we agreed upon. Pleasure working with you!",948,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,948,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,948,5
mturk_agent_1,hello I am not asking for the world just sharing,949,0
mturk_agent_2,Great🙂! Glad to hear that. What would you say your greatest need is in this?,949,0
mturk_agent_1,"I am old. Old people need hydration, more than younger people. Are you younger?",949,1
mturk_agent_2,"Ha! Youth is so subjective. I'm middle aged and plan on doing a lot of hiking, so I'm hoping to at least keep a hold of some water, but I'm definitely willing to split it with you. How do you feel about food and firewood?",949,1
mturk_agent_1,"Food is low priortity. I don't expend much energy, so that is why it is expendable.",949,2
mturk_agent_2,"Food's low priority for me as well. Water and firewood are really what I'm looking to have extras of because of where I'm camping. Do you think you need more firewood, or more water?",949,2
mturk_agent_1,Water is no 1.,949,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ah alright. I have an offer for you. It sounds like water is very important to both of us, but I'm willing to give you the majority of the water if I'm able to keep the firewood.You get 2 waters and all 3 food, and I'll take the remainder.",949,3
mturk_agent_1,"We are two exchanges away from 10, so let's agree, wish each other well and close with several more pleasant  exchanges.",949,4
mturk_agent_2,Agreed 🙂. I'll take 3 firewood and 1 water and you'll get everything else,949,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,949,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,949,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I will need alot of water as I need it to stay alive.",95,0
mturk_agent_1,"I agree, with camping i feel there are many uncertainties. Finding clean water would be too difficult, best to take as much water as possible. ",95,0
mturk_agent_2,I will also need some Firewood too to start a fire,95,1
mturk_agent_1,"I feel for firewood we dont need as much, as we are going to be camping, with that means, in my opinion, with branches and brush available, maybe we can take 2 fire woods, what do you think?",95,1
mturk_agent_2,"Since I got some food already, can I get 3 water, 2 firewood and 0 food then?",95,2
mturk_agent_1,"can we do at least one food? if thats okay with you? I would like to have extra food in case something happens, i will be able to have the extra supplies. ",95,2
mturk_agent_2,"ok, so list out the amount you need",95,3
mturk_agent_1,"water 3, firewood 2, and food 1, do you agree?",95,3
mturk_agent_2,"so you need 3 water, 2 firewood and 1 food?",95,4
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, I need 3 waters and 2 firewood and 1 food. I really believe the extra supplies will bring comfort in case something were to happen. what are your thoughts?",95,4
mturk_agent_2,"sorry, but I need alot of water too, you cannot get all 3",95,5
mturk_agent_1,"would you compromise with 2 waters, 2 firewood, and 0 food? ",95,5
mturk_agent_2,"most i can do is you get 2 water, 1 firewood and 0 food",95,6
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, thats fine, 2 waters, 1 firewood and 0 food, do we have a deal?",95,6
mturk_agent_2,"yes, you get 2 waters, 1 firewood and 0 food",95,7
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you so much, submitting deal. thank you ",95,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,95,8
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,95,8
mturk_agent_1,"hi, I'm excited to go camping soon",950,0
mturk_agent_2,Me too! What are you most interested in securing?,950,0
mturk_agent_1,I have a big need for firewood and could also use some water,950,1
mturk_agent_2,"Got it. My biggest need is water, but I'm happy to give you all the firewood if I can get all the water",950,1
mturk_agent_1,i think I could do that if you would be willing to give me 2 food,950,2
mturk_agent_2,"Food is my 2nd most important item, would you be open to taking just 1?",950,2
mturk_agent_1,I would take one if you would give me 1 water. It's my 2nd most important,950,3
mturk_agent_2,"OK let's just stick to this then. I get 3 water, 1 food, 0 firewood. you get 0 water, 2 food, 3 firewood. Does that work for you?",950,3
mturk_agent_1,"That works for me. 3 fire, 0 water, 2 food. Want to submit the deal?",950,4
mturk_agent_2,yes sounds good!,950,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,950,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,950,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello there.  Excited about this camping trip?,951,0
mturk_agent_1,Hey there! I am so excited - definitely could use a break from reality.  How about you?,951,0
mturk_agent_2,Definitely hear that.  Some solitude would do me well.  Thanks for asking. ,951,1
mturk_agent_1,What is your favorite part about camping?,951,1
mturk_agent_2,"The way it decompresses you, mentally, I'd say.  If that makes sense.  ",951,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, that does make sense.  Do you like to bring anything special on your camping trips?",951,2
mturk_agent_2,"Camera and books for sure.  I tend to go on impromptu hikes though, and that requires extra calories.  ",951,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, i'm sure it does.  I always make sure to bring water because I get dehydrated very quickly.",951,3
mturk_agent_2,"With that in mind, how would you like to split the extra packages of food and water?  I'll give you all the water for all the food, and we can split the remaining firewood. ",951,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds like a good deal - except there is 3 packages of firewood so we can't split it evenly.  I am bringing my daughter along and I would hate for her to be cold. Could I have 2 firewood and you 1?,951,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,951,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,951,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello there.,952,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you? hoping today is finding you well. I am taking 40 kids camping. I was wondering if its okay if I can get all 3 foods, I am willing to trade all waters for it. I really need the extra supplies, since the needs of children differ than adults. In case, the food is not properly stored or if the kids eat more",952,0
mturk_agent_2,"Interesting.  Well I do need some food, as I plan to go hiking.  For that I will need energy.",952,1
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, its our annual youth camp. I completely understand needed an extra food. are you in need of firewood? maybe we can work something out with firewood and water for all 3 foods. My kiddos are little rascals and east everything on sight.",952,1
mturk_agent_2,"If I have to shorten my hiking per day without extra food, I will need some heavy compensation because now it will take longer for me to reach my destination without energy.  Water alone will be hard.",952,2
mturk_agent_1,"I completely understand, what do you have in mind? will you be hiking alone or do you have people coming along?",952,2
mturk_agent_2,I will be hiking alone on this trip.  I would consider giving you all the food.  I would need all the water and firewood in return.  The firewood would be helpful to keep animals away while I rest.,952,3
mturk_agent_1,"I completely understand as I too was thinking of using firewood not to only keep wild life away, but the bugs. Will you be okay if i get one fire wood? I have alot of cooking to do. not sure if it will be raining when we go camping, and if it is raining, I am unsure if I will be able to use the tree branches and brush.. since they will be wet. what do you think? ",952,3
mturk_agent_2,I suppose I can give you one firewood.,952,4
mturk_agent_1,"thank you so much. you are very kind, the kiddos will be happy to hear about the extra supplies. to recap I will be getting 3 waters 1 fire wood and 0 waters. ",952,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,952,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,952,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for us both.,953,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello there.  I am absolutely interested in coming to an agreement as well.  it's pleasant to meet you!,953,0
mturk_agent_2,Nice to meet you too. So what do you need most?,953,1
mturk_agent_1,"So, I'm a chef.  My largest concern is getting a nice, hot, fire.  In order to do that I'll need firewood the most.  What are you looking for the most?",953,1
mturk_agent_2,"That's awesome! I am most definitely NOT a chef, but I'm going to be doing a lot of hiking, so I'll need a lot of water to stay hydrated. And a bit of extra food to keep us all full.",953,2
mturk_agent_1,"Fair enough.  I'm also going to need a bit of water, but I'm sure we can come to an agreement fair for both of us.  As far as food goes, I only require very little, my pantry already is pretty stocked there.",953,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well, if I take 2 waters and you take 1, will you let me have all of the food?",953,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think that's asking a bit too much, because I still would like some food.  I'd be willing to take all the firewood, one water, and one food, if that sounds passable to you.",953,3
mturk_agent_2,"Well, if I'm splitting the food and water with you, I'd like a single firewood. I'm no chef, but it'll be freezing cold overnight, and I just need a little extra to keep warm.",953,4
mturk_agent_1,"I must insist on the Firewood, that's the most important thing to me - you should have enough from your default package for a nice fire.  I could use more water, but I'm letting you take the lions share of that, so I think one food isn't too unfair for that.",953,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, that's fair. You put in the deal, and I'll gladly accept.",953,5
mturk_agent_1,Alrighty.  Hope you have fun on your hiking!  Make sure you stay hydrated.  Going to push it through now.,953,5
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds good, you have fun, too! And good luck cooking up all that food, chef!",953,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,953,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,953,7
mturk_agent_1,"Hello,how are you doing today?",954,0
mturk_agent_2,Great I hope you are.  I would love to have all three food.  I have a medical condition that burns more calories than a normal person so need more food,954,0
mturk_agent_1,Dang that's terrible. Sadly I'm going to need some food too as mine spoiled in my cooler ☹️,954,1
mturk_agent_2,"I also sweat like crazy so need replenishment.  So how about I get 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood",954,1
mturk_agent_1,"How about 1 food, 1 firewood and 3 water?",954,2
mturk_agent_2,i really need the food!! how about 2 food and 2 firewood,954,2
mturk_agent_1,I don't need any water because there is a lake nearby. How about I take 1 food and 3 firewood then?,954,3
mturk_agent_2,and I get 2 food and 3 water,954,3
mturk_agent_1,Sure,954,4
mturk_agent_2,that sounds fair to me,954,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,954,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,954,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I would really prefer the extra water and firewood.",955,0
mturk_agent_1,"I understand. I, too, really need the water. I have my puppy with me, and wan to be sure he has plenty to drink. Why is it that you need the water and firewwod?",955,0
mturk_agent_2,"I have kidney disease and need the extra water for the trip, I also love a good meal and love to cook over the fire.🙂",955,1
mturk_agent_1,I am willing to give more of the firewood to make sure my puppy has enough to stay hydrated. 🙂,955,1
mturk_agent_2,Wouldn't your puppy also need more of the food?,955,2
mturk_agent_1,"We need a little extra food, but could easily share that. ",955,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well I bring my own food, so would be willing to give you all of the extra. 🙂",955,3
mturk_agent_1,"I am most concerned about her hydration. He will be allowed to be more active because of the extra space, and since it is his first time I was unsure of how much he would need. I don't mind sharing the food , and if you had extra firewood, extra food would be great!🙂",955,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can make due with one water, and all of the firewood. You can have the extra two waters and the food. Should satisfy us both.",955,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds great! Thank you so much!,955,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,955,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,955,5
mturk_agent_1,Good afternoon! How are you?,956,0
mturk_agent_2,i'm fine. wehat about you?,956,0
mturk_agent_1,I can't complain! Just looing forward to going camping! Do you think you can spare some firewood?,956,1
mturk_agent_2,i have only one spare,956,1
mturk_agent_1,I understand and would appreciate it if you would give me the spare! Is there any way you might give me all of the food? I tend to get really hungry!,956,2
mturk_agent_2,but i need 2 pack of firewood 2 pack water and 1 pack of food,956,2
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, I can accomodate that. So you will give me one firewood, one water, and two foods, right?",956,3
mturk_agent_2,okay fine. it will be better for us,956,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay! We have a deal! Now let the camping fun begin!,956,4
mturk_agent_2,yeah sure.  thank you for your time with me,956,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,956,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,956,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello!  Great to see you, here for a hike to the Lake?🙂",957,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes but I am going to camping trip🙂,957,0
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, I am camping also.  My wife and mother-in-law are down geting the site permit and trail maps.  I'm trying to sort out our supplies.  We flew in and the airline loss the bag with our sleeping bags and food.☹️",957,1
mturk_agent_1,Oh so sorry to hear that. I am also in a need of supplies. I am mostly worried about water as I do get dehydrated easily and cannot function properly like that😮. What are your concerns?,957,1
mturk_agent_2,Well I see they have some extra supplies to split between the sites.  I really need food and firewood to help keep everyone happy. ,957,2
mturk_agent_1,I would be happy to give you the entire food supply if I can get all the water. But I would like a minimum of two firewood because I also get very cold and am afraid of dark - so would have to burn it all night long. I would be scared to run out. Ideally would like to have all of it but I understand that you would need some.,957,2
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds good on the food and water, but my mother-in-law is going to give me a lot of grief if she sees a small pile of wood here.  Being that there is a fire pit between our sites can I convince you to let me have two of the wood and we can put on as much as we need to keep it going between us.   I really need points with my mother-in-law! 🙂🙂",957,3
mturk_agent_1,"I am going with my fiancee and she would ""kill"" me if I cannot secure enough firewood. I think I cannot budge on this. She will probably already be upset that I did not get more firewood.. 😮",957,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds tough to deal with also.  How about you take the two wood but I get a water?,957,4
mturk_agent_1,Then I would need some food. ☹️,957,4
mturk_agent_2,"No that won't work.  I can survive with the 3 food for me, 3 water for you, and 2 firewood for you and 1 for me.  Shall we make that a deal?",957,5
mturk_agent_1,"So you would get 3 food and 1 firewood, yes. 🙂",957,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,957,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,957,6
mturk_agent_1,hi there!  i'm mostly interested in wood,958,0
mturk_agent_2,hi! am with my family on the camping trip and giving all my wood wont be a good thing to do though am low on water ,958,0
mturk_agent_1,what if you take 1 wood and i take 1 water? and then we split the food?,958,1
mturk_agent_2,"no!!....lets make it this way, how about i take 2 water and i give you 1 firewood and 1 food",958,1
mturk_agent_1,"that's really not fair!  you would end up with 2 water, 2 wood and 2 food!!  i will need 2 wood, 1 water and 2 food. ",958,2
mturk_agent_2,how about we balance things up,958,2
mturk_agent_1,"yes, that's what i'm hoping for as well.  your first offer was very unfair",958,3
mturk_agent_2,"am sorry, how about you get 1 food  and i get 1 water",958,3
mturk_agent_1,"yes, in addition to 2 wood",958,4
mturk_agent_2,no!!,958,4
mturk_agent_1,"i will take 2 wood, 1 food and 1 water.  you get 1 wood, 2 food and 2 water.  how is that unfair to you?",958,5
mturk_agent_2,"am high on food, how about we renegotiate, you will get 1 wood 1 food 1 water and i also get the same  ",958,5
mturk_agent_1,we need to divide 3 of each,958,6
mturk_agent_2,"okay, you get 2 food, 1 wood, 1 water, i get 1 food, 1 water  ",958,6
mturk_agent_1,ok great,958,7
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,958,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,958,8
mturk_agent_2,"Good afternoon! I hope you're having a wonderful day. I'm plotting a backcountry camping trip with friends, so food is my top priority, with water as the second. What are your needs?",959,0
mturk_agent_1,That's funny because I am doing the same with the same priorities.  Funny world we live in 🙂.  I think we can come to a fair compromise though.,959,0
mturk_agent_2,Definetly. Would you be more flexible on food or water? I'm more flexible on having less water. I can usually find some that can be treated on the hike.,959,1
mturk_agent_1,"As we have the same priorities, I have the same flexibility 🙂.  I am willing to forgo all the water if I can get at least one firewood.  I can figure out how to pack a camelbak full before I arrive.",959,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'm looking to get 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood out of the deal. What would your offer be?",959,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think that's fair.  I can take 1 food, 2 waters, and 2 firewood.",959,2
mturk_agent_2,"I'm usually more flexible on firewood than I am anything else, as I have a small camp stove. I feel this way is the best, do you have any other ideas?",959,3
mturk_agent_1,"I need to figure how to pack more food in my backpack now, but I think that's a deal that works for both of us.",959,3
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, so let me get this right: I get 2 food, 1 water, 1 firewood. You get 1 food, 2 waters, 2 firewood? Does that look right?",959,4
mturk_agent_1,That is perfect for me.,959,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,959,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,959,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello. I'm looking forward to striking a deal with you that makes both of us happy!,96,0
mturk_agent_1,Sure I am waiting too!,96,0
mturk_agent_2,"So tell me, which is most important to you? What can't you live without?",96,1
mturk_agent_1,The most important is water because I have kidney problem so i need some more water.Without water I can't live.,96,1
mturk_agent_2,"I understand that completely. Would you be willing to take 2 waters, and I take 1 water? I still do need some water for my family. I can't have anyone getting heat stroke. But you can have more.",96,2
mturk_agent_1,Okay.But I need whole water to survive.,96,2
mturk_agent_2,"Of course. So, what about food? I will definitely need the food. I have a big family, and we all need to eat. I can't have people starving. Can I take all of the food?",96,3
mturk_agent_1,Okay I accept that.,96,3
mturk_agent_2,"Wonderful. And what about the firewood? I would like 2 firewood, and I can give you 1 firewood. Will you accept that?",96,4
mturk_agent_1,Okay I accept your deal.,96,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,96,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,96,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hi there, I was thinking that I could have 3 Firewood, 3 Food, and you can have all of the water? I have a water supply nearby and dont need that but food is scarce and I need the firewood to cook throughout the day.",960,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello. This is no good for me. I do need a lot of water because I am bringing my dog Jedi with me. He drinks a lot when he's active. I will also need some firewood. How about I take all of the 2 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food? ",960,0
mturk_agent_2,"I can understand the water for the dog, but I don't see why you would need 2 food and 1 firewood also. I have myself and my girlfriend and 2 kids going which is why I am more concerned for the food and heat. How many people are camping with you?",960,1
mturk_agent_1,Understood 🙂 I have two adults and a dog. How do you think things could be split equitably? ,960,1
mturk_agent_2,"I feel that it would be reasonable, that I take the 3 firewood, 2 food, and no water. That leaves you with 3 water for you and your group, 1 food to split, and firewood you would have an easier time to collect than I would having to keep track of 2 toddlers in the woods. ",960,2
mturk_agent_1,"I am excited to go camping. My arthritis doesn't seem to hurt as much when I'm communing with nature, but even as excited as I am, I cannot accept this deal. I would really like some food and firewood too. What if you get 1 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food? ",960,2
mturk_agent_2,"I completely understand and know how the weather and nature can help with body pain but I cannot accept that deal. I have a girlfriend and 2 kids along with myself. That is 2 more people than you, which means I need more supplies. This is the first trip we have been able to take together as a family and I want to make it memorable for the kids especially. I feel it would be fair then if I got 2 firewood, 2 food, and 1 water then. It gives you a supply of each and more than enough water to last the trip for you and yours.",960,3
mturk_agent_1,"That will be fun for your family. Are you sure you wouldn't consider giving me 2 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water? The heat from the fire would help my arthritis tremendously and it would add to my enjoyment of the camping experience. ",960,3
mturk_agent_2,"I really would rather keep the firewood for my kids so that I can take the time to teach them the proper way to start fires and the safety of it all. I can negotiate on the others but the firewood I would really rather keep 2 for myself, and either 2 food for me and you can have all 3 waters or 2 wood, 1 food, and 1 water. Would either of those work for you?",960,4
mturk_agent_1,"You do have more people to feed, and you definitely have to pack extra supplies for the children. How about I have 3 waters, 1 wood, and 1 food? ",960,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,960,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,960,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello there! 🙂,961,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello,961,0
mturk_agent_2,How are you?,961,1
mturk_agent_1,"Great, how about you?",961,1
mturk_agent_2,Pretty good myself,961,2
mturk_agent_1,I really need Food and Fire.  We have a very large group of people with us and it gets very cold at night,961,2
mturk_agent_2,"Well i too need that, We have large family with a breastfeeding mother, aswell as a child who has a medical condition where they struggle to keep a normal body temp",961,3
mturk_agent_1,You can have all the water you want🙂🙂 just give me the firewood and food,961,3
mturk_agent_2,Ill take 1 food and 1 firewood and all the water you can have the rest,961,4
mturk_agent_1,That sounds pretty fair to me!,961,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,961,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,961,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello there! 🙂,962,0
mturk_agent_2,Hi!,962,0
mturk_agent_1,I would like to make a deal with you. What are your preferences on the items you need most?,962,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well, last time we went camping my daughter got dehydrated so I would really like extra water. How about you?",962,1
mturk_agent_1,My priority would also be water as well as food. My wife is currently pregnant and it is required of her to drink plenty of water and eat food often. She is constantly thirsty and hungry.,962,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, water is important. I agree. We are having some underprivileged kids staying with us also so we need extra food too for them.",962,2
mturk_agent_1,I totally understand! I'm afraid for how the weather will be and that my wife and unborn baby will need some more nourishment than usual,962,3
mturk_agent_2,What do you think is more important for her? Water or food if you had to choose?,962,3
mturk_agent_1,I believe that water would be the most important. The doctor is always pushing for her to drink more water. We don't have as many mouths to feed so I feel that we won't need as much food as you.,962,4
mturk_agent_2,Are you thinking that you might need more firewood also? Will it be chilly where you are?,962,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,962,5
mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,962,5
mturk_agent_2,I can give you more water if I can have all the wood.,962,6
mturk_agent_1,It won't be very chilly where I am so you can have all the wood. My priority is water and food.,962,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,962,7
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,962,7
mturk_agent_1,hai🙂,963,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, have you camped here before🙂",963,0
mturk_agent_1,Yes.What about you?,963,1
mturk_agent_2,"We come here often, do you need any supplies??",963,1
mturk_agent_1,Okay that's fine.Yeah I need additional water item from the packages.,963,2
mturk_agent_2,"We have plenty of water, would you happen to have any firewood?",963,2
mturk_agent_1,Hey wow! Thank you for your information. I need more water and food instead of firewood.,963,3
mturk_agent_2,"I can trade you 3 waters for 3 woods, and you want to talk about food too?",963,3
mturk_agent_1,Thank you so much for giving 3 waters and 3 foods to me.I need food because I have 2 older people with me so they need to eat more healthy food to live.,963,4
mturk_agent_2,"Since you have older people and in the interest of getting this done, i'll give you 2 foods and i'll take one",963,4
mturk_agent_1,But you already told me that you gave 3 water and 3 food to me right?,963,5
mturk_agent_2,"no i said i can trade you 3 waters for 3 woods, and then we can talk about food. I'll take 1 food you can have 2, then we are done and can camp🙂",963,5
mturk_agent_1,Sorry. Okay I accept the deal.,963,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,963,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,963,7
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I hope we can work together on this negotiation so we are both satisfied.🙂",964,0
mturk_agent_1,"I think that should be easily done, I'm in a very agreeable mood today 🙂",964,0
mturk_agent_2,"Great!, I would like to know what you need most and what you least need.🙂",964,1
mturk_agent_1,"Let's start off with what's most important.  I'm a hungry man, working hard, food is my most important extra.  How about you?",964,1
mturk_agent_2,What I need the most is Firewood since I don't have the strength to look for more.☹️,964,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well today is your lucky day because I care the least about firewood!  What's more important to you, food or water?",964,2
mturk_agent_2,"I need more of food, but since it is what you need the most you should keep 2 of food. Water is what I need the least since I brought a lot🙂",964,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think we can work something out here.  How about I take 2 food, 2 water, and 0 firewood.  You take 1 food, 1 water, and 3 firewood?",964,3
mturk_agent_2,That sounds fair to me. Why don't you need wood?,964,4
mturk_agent_1,"I'll be honest, it's hot out where I am.  I can collect enough dead wood in addition to our basic supplies for cooking and I really don't need a fire going at night.  I feel like taking more food and water means I'll have more energy to gather it up.",964,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,964,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,964,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello how are you?,965,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hey there, I am well thank you. How's it going?",965,0
mturk_agent_2,Doing good can I negotiate more Firewood from you?,965,1
mturk_agent_1,I'd be willing to consider tha negotiation. Could you tell me more about why you need more firewood?,965,1
mturk_agent_2,I would need it for cooking my food and also I tend to get cold at night.,965,2
mturk_agent_1,I totally understand 🙂 I really need food so I think we can work something out that is fair.,965,2
mturk_agent_2,Sounds good I know how to hunt and fish so that won't be a problem,965,3
mturk_agent_1,"Perfect, let me know your offer 🙂 and lets see what we can agree on?",965,3
mturk_agent_2,So how about 3 packages of Firewood for me and 2 packages of food 2 packages water for you?,965,4
mturk_agent_1,"You know, that is perfect for me. I will accept the offer 🙂",965,4
mturk_agent_2,Ok that sounds great.  Nice negotating with you!,965,5
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,965,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,965,6
mturk_agent_1,Will you please give me 2 packages of food?,966,0
mturk_agent_2,"If I give you 2 packages of food, can you give me 2 packages of Firewood ? ",966,0
mturk_agent_1,"That will be tricky, let me give you 2 packages of water and 1 package of firewood.",966,1
mturk_agent_2,I have a higher need for Firewood. I can give you 2 packages of food and 1 package of water for 2 packages of firewood ,966,1
mturk_agent_1,Oay seems like we have a deal.,966,2
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, great! It was a pleasure working with you! ",966,2
mturk_agent_1,Pleasure is all mine🙂,966,3
mturk_agent_2,"So, to be clear. You agree to get 1 package of fire Wood, 2 Packages of water, and 2 Packages of food? ",966,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, that's right.",966,4
mturk_agent_2,"Ok, great! I am glad we are both in consensus on that. ",966,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,966,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,966,5
mturk_agent_1,Hello,967,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello,",967,0
mturk_agent_1,Is there anything you would be willing to part with?,967,1
mturk_agent_2,"I'd be willing to part with 2 of the waters.  I don't think that it's going to be that hot, and I don't really like drinking water.",967,1
mturk_agent_1,Hmm. I would be willing to trade you two packages of food for one water and one firewood.,967,2
mturk_agent_2,"Do you mean that I would get 2 firewood, 2 food, and 2 firewood??",967,2
mturk_agent_1,"In exchange of two of my food packages for one of your waters and one of your foods, you would then have 5 foods, 2 waters, and 2 firewoods.",967,3
mturk_agent_2,"That doesn't work.  There are only a total of 3 firewood, 3 food, and 3 water.  Can I have 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water?",967,3
mturk_agent_1,"I suppose I misread the instructions, or they were not very clear, I had read them as we each had 3 packages each of the 3 items. ",967,4
mturk_agent_2,"We each have basic camping supplies.  We need to split the additional 3 firewood, 3 food, and 3 water.  What supplies do you want the most?",967,4
mturk_agent_1,OK. I would much prefer the firewood.,967,5
mturk_agent_2,"I also want firewood, but I'll give up some for additional food.  Can I have 1 firewood, 3 food, and 1 water?",967,5
mturk_agent_1,"I'm good with that, I'd rather carry wood than food.",967,6
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,967,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,967,7
mturk_agent_1,Hello how are you today? I would like 3 firewood because I will be camping in subzero temperatures. My friends will not have the food needed so I would ask for 1 extra food and give you 2. I am easily dehydrated so 1 extra water would help.,968,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I can give you two firewood because I need one to keep my family warm while camping. I can offer you two waters so that you are better hydrated and one food as well. ",968,0
mturk_agent_1,I would prefer 3 firewood. You can have 3 food and 1 water.,968,1
mturk_agent_2,I'm afraid that I cannot give all 3 firewood and would need at least one of them. I will offer one more water or food in addition. ,968,1
mturk_agent_1,I understand that you need 1 firewood. What was that for?,968,2
mturk_agent_2,I will need one firewood to keep my family warm while camping. ,968,2
mturk_agent_1,OH yes now I remember that. 🙂,968,3
mturk_agent_2,"And I understand the subzero temps will be hard to weather, which is why I would like to offer you two firewood. ",968,3
mturk_agent_1,"I will accept the offer of 2 firewood, 1 food, and 2 water. 🙂 ",968,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, that is a deal. ",968,4

mturk_agent_2,hi,969,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello. How are you? 🙂,969,0
mturk_agent_2,Good thanks. I think water is heaviest to carry so it should be split ,969,1
mturk_agent_1,We can do that. How about 2 for me and 1 for you?,969,1
mturk_agent_2,thats fair. In exchange I could have two food packages and one wood? You'd get one food and two woods?,969,2
mturk_agent_1,sure that sounds pretty fair to me too,969,2
mturk_agent_2,awesome 🙂,969,3

mturk_agent_1,Hello there! How are you today?,97,0
mturk_agent_2,I am fine . How about you?,97,0
mturk_agent_1,I am doing well so far. 🙂 What items are of preference for you today?,97,1
mturk_agent_2,I need a lot of food today. I was advised to eat at least 4 times a day so i may need all the food packages.,97,1
mturk_agent_1,Well that is not going to work well for my family of 8 now is it? Haha. I think we can come to some sort of agreement though.🙂,97,2
mturk_agent_2,What do you propose?,97,2
mturk_agent_1,"I really need food too, but I am willing to deal and let my kids go hungry I guess ☹️ I propose I get one food, 3 firewood and 1 water.  ",97,3
mturk_agent_2,Will you please give me one firewood? I may run out of what i have. Just one.,97,3
mturk_agent_1,I think I will need all the firewood since you are taking 2 foods. I will need to hunt and cook food from the land meaning I need my fire going all the time.,97,4
mturk_agent_2,I need one more to light a fire to scare away animals. Please😮,97,4
mturk_agent_1,"Then How about I get two foods, 1 firewood and 1 water?",97,5
mturk_agent_2,Like i said food is my top priority so i will not do well with less than 2.,97,5
mturk_agent_1,Then you get two food and no firewood here.😮,97,6
mturk_agent_2,You mean you can't let up one firewood for me?,97,6
mturk_agent_1,"Not this time, I really need all the firewood and food is a large need for my family of 8. We need the firewood to cook all our meals from the animals we hunt since we are short on food.",97,7
mturk_agent_2,But these are only additional packages☹️,97,7
mturk_agent_1,I get that and understand completely. I have a large number of mouths to feed making the food a necessity or all the firewood to cook whatever we hunt. How many you have?,97,8
mturk_agent_2,I have three.,97,8
mturk_agent_1,I have 8. That is 5 more people to feed for 3 meals per day....,97,9

mturk_agent_2,"Well if you want all the food, then I should take 3 water and 2 firewood",970,3

mturk_agent_2,Hi! How are you doing today?,971,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello, how are you today? hoping today is finding you well. I am going camping with my youth camp, 40 kids! lots of work on my end. I was wondering If its okay with you, if I can get all 3 waters? I am willing to give you all 3 of my Firewood? i really need the extra supplies for cooking, cleaning, and to compensate for the amount of water kids will be spilling. what are your thoughts?",971,0
mturk_agent_2,"Wow, 40 kids.  Thats lot.  I decided to bring my family with me today including my grandmother, grandfather and young children.  I was hoping to at least get one water to make my baby some formula.  So I propose I take 1 water, 2 food and all firewood?",971,1
mturk_agent_1,"its our annual youth camp, lots of fun but with a lot of work. Oh no! I completely understand your worries, as I will be having kids as young as 2 at the camp. I am willing to part with 2 foods and all firewood for all 3 waters. Not wanting to disregard your family, but my numbers truly need the extra supplies of water. specially with the amount of cooking I will be doing. We are camping for 15 days. May I ask how long you are camping for? ",971,1
mturk_agent_2,"I completely understand, children are very important.  They are our future.  We are camping for 14 days.  I wanted to give my children/family the experience of living outdoors with out the technology and other distractions we typically have at home.  I am willing to agree to 2 foods, 3 firewood.  I believe it is fair for both of us",971,2
mturk_agent_1,"I completely agree with you, different ages as well, required different needs. One thing I have learned camping, the more supplies you'll have the better off, you will be. just to confirm, I will be getting 3 waters, 1 food, and 0 FW. ",971,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, I will be taking 2 foods and 3 Firewoods.  I hope you have amazing camping trip",971,3
mturk_agent_1,wishing you the same! where are you guys camping to? we are going to colorado! 🙂,971,3

mturk_agent_1,"I'm fine, thanks. I understand what you're saying, I'm a big guy too and also want to do a lot of hiking, so I might need extra food as well.",972,1
mturk_agent_2,We can probably split the food. What else are you looking for?,972,1
mturk_agent_1,"Well, if I want to hike I might need more water. What's your take on extra water?",972,2
mturk_agent_2,I don't really get the thirsty so I don't need much water. I do need firewood though because I'm worried about my fire dying.,972,2
mturk_agent_1,"Oh, I think we're reaching middle ground here. I really think I have enough firewood, you can have it all if you need it. 🙂",972,3
mturk_agent_2,"Okay great! So how about you get all the water, I get all the firewood, and we split the food?",972,3
mturk_agent_1,"Yeah, I agree. One thing, how do we split the food?",972,4
mturk_agent_2,How about I get 2 and you get 1?,972,4
mturk_agent_1,"I agree but, in that case, can I take 1 of the firewood packages? It'd be 2 food packages and 2 firewood packages for you.",972,5
mturk_agent_2,"Sure, that sounds good to me!",972,5
mturk_agent_1,I think we have a deal!,972,6

mturk_agent_1,"I'm doing great, how about yourself?",973,0
mturk_agent_2,Doing good. What resources do you need?,973,1
mturk_agent_1,"I'm in need of firewood. It's a family tradition to tell stories around the campfire, so I want to be sure we're well stocked for the weekend.",973,1
mturk_agent_2,That sounds like a very cool tradition. Would you be good with two firewood and 1 each of water and food?,973,2
mturk_agent_1,"That sounds reasonable, but I'm hoping I'd be able to get 2 food instead of 1. I've got two young kids who eat A LOT, so I want to make sure they're well fed and in good moods 🙂",973,2
mturk_agent_2,I'm a bodybuilder so that extra food is kinda essential sorry. ,973,3
mturk_agent_1,"I totally understand. If that's the case, though, I think I'll need 3 firewood to ensure I can keep them occupied with stories when they get hungry.",973,3
mturk_agent_2,You can have three firewood if I get three water and two food. I'm giving you the top item so i think I should get some concessions. ,973,4
mturk_agent_1,"I appreciate that. However, I will need at least 1 water. You're already getting the majority of the food, and you're welcome to the majority of the water as well. I do need to keep the kids hydrated though 🙂",973,4

mturk_agent_2,Yep! What are you most interested in?,974,1
mturk_agent_1,I believe that I need most of the food because I eat a lot to begin with but everything else is negotiable,974,1
mturk_agent_2,"OK makes sense. You can have all the food, but I'll need 3 water and 2 firewood",974,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think I need water also, you know, just in case. What about 1 water and you can have all the fire wood  ",974,2
mturk_agent_2,OK I can do that,974,3
mturk_agent_1,"Alright, so your going have 3 firewood and 2 water and I get the rest. Sounds good? ",974,3

mturk_agent_2,What do you need most?,975,0
mturk_agent_1,i need water the most  followed by food what about you?,975,1
mturk_agent_2,I actually think water is a priority for my family as well. ,975,1
mturk_agent_1,okay so what do we suggest we do.can i take 2 water while you take 1 and you can have 2 firewood as well.What do you think,975,2
mturk_agent_2,I can give 1 package of water and 2 packages of food and firewood 🙂,975,2
mturk_agent_1,okay so i get 1 water 2 food 2 firewood while you get 2 water 1 food and 1 firewood?,975,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that is correct. ",975,3
mturk_agent_1,but can i spare 1 more water for me so my family do not starve,975,4
mturk_agent_2,That is a very tough decision for me. My son suffers from dehydration quite often so I will definitely need the water.,975,4

mturk_agent_1,"Sorry, I really need firewood. Where we're camping is up in the mountains and really cold. I think we'll be thirsty too.",976,1
mturk_agent_2,"Water is not a problem for me. How about 2 firewood for you and 3 waters? Then I take 1 firewood, 3 foods and 0 water?",976,2

mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,976,5
mturk_agent_1,"Hi there.  I tend to get cold at night when I go camping, so I'm hoping we can make a deal for this extra firewood.",977,0
mturk_agent_2,Hello. That's too bad. I'll try and help out.,977,0
mturk_agent_1,"Great!  Since there's a pile of extra supplies here, is there something that'd make your camping trip go really well that we could make a bargain about?",977,1
mturk_agent_2,"Well we plan to do quite a bit of hiking, so some extra water would be awesome.🙂",977,1
mturk_agent_1,"Sure.  Well, I do like to make coffee in the mornings too but if we could maybe let me take most of the spare food I could spare you the water.",977,2
mturk_agent_2,That sounds fair. You must have a good appetite then?,977,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well, my family's always said that if you can't get your energy from coffee, a hearty meal in the morning can be just as good.",977,3
mturk_agent_2,"Haha.🙂 Alright so you can take all the firewood, I'll take the water, and you can have two of the food. You got a little bit better deal but that's ok.",977,3
mturk_agent_1,"It's a bit of a tradeoff because of the water, but I think we both deserve a good camping trip here. 🙂",977,4
mturk_agent_2,You can visit our site and have some coffee with us before we head out hiking.,977,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,977,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,977,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, I would like to get some firewood for my camping, some extra water because I only consume water as my drink, and I have some extra people to feed so I would like some extra food.",978,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hello🙂 Firewood is all yours because I can obtain more throughout the campsite if need be. I would need extra water because I also only consume water. I would also need food for myself, because I do not need to feed extra people. I will be riding this one out by myself🙂",978,0
mturk_agent_2,Great! I will take the firewood for sure.,978,1
mturk_agent_1,Would you agree to me getting 2 Water/ 2 Food/ 0 Firewood and you would get 1 Water/ 1 Food/ 3 Firewood?,978,1
mturk_agent_2,I think that would work for me. I do really need the firewood since I seem to always be cold. :) I am okay with the other proposal as to the food. I am not sure about the water yet just because I don't know if I would need more than you are offering🙂,978,2
mturk_agent_1,"Well thanks for your consideration, that seemed to work out. 🙂  I would still need some water for my dog who always goes camping with me. He helps me out with hunting and finding my way around when hiking and he will also be my only company. I would hate to have to leave him behind due to lack of water or food. How can we resolve this??",978,2
mturk_agent_2,"Yeah, dogs are great companions and I know how much they want to be with their people and obviously, you would want them to be around. I guess you would need the water more than I would at this time since your dog would be coming along with you.",978,3
mturk_agent_1,Wow Thank You so much for your consideration and for being so understanding. I really appreciate that. So are we agreeing to the original offer shown above? YOU: 3 Firewood/ 1 Food/ 1 Water and ME: 0 Firewood/ 2 Food/ 2 Water?,978,3
mturk_agent_2,"Yes, that does work for me. I will be willing to accept the 3 Firewood, 1 Water, and 1 Food. You will get the 0 Firewood, 2 Water, and 2 Food. Plus, I would like to meet your lovely dog 🙂🙂",978,4
mturk_agent_1,"Well that is just great!🙂 I am so happy that we were able to work this out. And yes my lovely dog Rex is always willing to make new friends like you! It has been great to be able to chat and work this out with you, we will look forward to seeing you at camp🙂",978,4

mturk_agent_2,"Hi, food is the most important to me right now. I plan on hiking a lot, so I'll need to refuel. What about you?",979,0
mturk_agent_1,"Water is most important to me. However, food is a close second.",979,1
mturk_agent_2,"Water is a close second for me, so we have different specific needs. ",979,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes. Have you considered how useful water may be to you if food is your highest priority? ,979,2
mturk_agent_2,"Water is a bit useful, but food is the priority. Is food going to be a priority to you?",979,2
mturk_agent_1,Yes it is. Firewood should be higher on your list since food is the most important to you. You need to be able to cook,979,3
mturk_agent_2,"Water is second because we plan to hike, so the food would be packages that don't necessarily need a lot of firewood. We also plan to sleep early. ",979,3
mturk_agent_1,Yes but how will you stay warm in the night? It may also scare away predators in the night time.,979,4

mturk_agent_1,"Nice. Same, it's over 100 degrees where I live. 🙂",98,1
mturk_agent_2,"Yikes! It's a bit colder up here, that's why I would like to bring some extra firewood to stay warm at night.",98,2

mturk_agent_2,Great! What extra supplies would you like to bring?,98,3
mturk_agent_1,"Since it's hot there, I get thirsty and dry real quick. 😡",98,3
mturk_agent_2,"Oh ok, well I plan on bringing some juice, beer and other drinks. So I could spare some extra water. And I am pretty good at fishing, so I won't need much food either",98,4

mturk_agent_1,This is actually my first time camping. Have you ever gone before?,980,0
mturk_agent_2,A few times.  I'd be willing to share my fire with you if you don't know how to light one of your own.,980,1
mturk_agent_1,I was hoping you would have extra firewood to spare with me. I could trade some for some water.,980,1
mturk_agent_2,Here's the problem.  I'll build and tend the fire but I'll need two packages to do that.  But I'll only need one water package.  ,980,2
mturk_agent_1,"I don't really need that much water either, but I need extra firewood because I'm anemic and alway feel cold. Do you have extra food I could trade as well?",980,2
mturk_agent_2,"Oh, wow.  You're anemic.  I'm diabetic so I need to eat frequently so that I don't have a low blood sugar episode.  I can exchange give you one food package, two firewoods and one water.",980,3
mturk_agent_1,That sounds perfect 🙂 I'm also hoping to make some smores with the grandkids one night. I'm so excited.,980,3

mturk_agent_1,Sure 🙂 I actually completely forgot water at home so I was wondering if I could take all three packages of water,981,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes that works for me if I could get all three firewood.  It is supposed to be cold tonight.  ,981,1
mturk_agent_1,"Do you think maybe you could get 2 packages of firewood and I get one package? I would be happy to let you have 2 of 3 food packages, I'm trying not to over do it on food",981,1
mturk_agent_2,Well we do need food for the animals.  Could we also get one of the waters then?,981,2
mturk_agent_1,I do really need the water. What if you took all 3 of the food packages and 2 of the firewood?,981,2
mturk_agent_2,I would really want all 3 firewood if I'm not getting any water.  How important is the water to you?,981,3
mturk_agent_1,"The water is the highest priority for me, but I would also like just one firewood package so I can make sure my group keeps warm tonight",981,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about we take 1 water, 2 firewood and 3 food?",981,4
mturk_agent_1,"Hmm, I'm afraid I can't agree to that. You would be getting 6 packages while I'm left with only 3. I'm afraid I'm going to have to walk away from that deal",981,4
mturk_agent_2,Ok how about you take all 3 water and 1 firewood.  You would be getting all 3 of your highest priority and I wouldn't be but I would be getting 1 more package,981,5

mturk_agent_1,Hello,982,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I'm so excited for my camping trip!",982,0
mturk_agent_1,Me too! What is your highest priority item to bring?,982,1
mturk_agent_2,Water. I'm a little sketched out about drinking lake water.,982,1
mturk_agent_1,Me too. I have a super sensitive stomach and the last thing I want is to have an upset stomach. What would be your second most important?,982,2
mturk_agent_2,"Food, we're doing a bunch of hiking so i don't want anyone getting weak.",982,2
mturk_agent_1,"I think that's a smart decision. How about you can have all the food if I can have all the firewood? I don't really need food, i am good at foraging ",982,3
mturk_agent_2,"That works for me, but I also need to keep a lot of water so how about I keep 2 food and 2 water and you get all the firewood?",982,3
mturk_agent_1,"So I would get all the firewood, one water and one food? Just want to make sure I understand.",982,4
mturk_agent_2,yes. are you ok with that?,982,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,982,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,982,5
mturk_agent_2,Hi its great to meet you.  How about we split up these extra goods.  I really need some extra food and firwood.  Spent all day flying here and they loss my bag with my sleeping bag and a fair bit of my food.,983,0
mturk_agent_1,Hi! It is nice to meet you too. I think it's a good idea to split the goods too.  I was rushing trying to get things ready and completely forgot to bring water and I think I am a bit short on food,983,0
mturk_agent_2,"Sounds like we are in similar situation.  How about 2 water for you and 1 for me, 2 food for me/1 for you, 2 firewood for me and 1 for you? ",983,1
mturk_agent_1,I completely agree with you about the water and the firewood but I have a few kids with me who are just bottomless pits 🙂 and could really use 2 foods for me and 1 food for you,983,1
mturk_agent_2,Dont want the kids to go hungr  But I do need to eat some too.  How about you take the 3 water  and while we keep the food and wood as first proposed?🙂,983,2
mturk_agent_1,Hungry kids are not happy kids.  I can see that you are really in need of some additional food.  Are you by yourself?,983,2
mturk_agent_2,"No, my wife and mother inlaw are down at the ranger station getting a trail map.  ",983,3
mturk_agent_1,"Nice family vacation 🙂 I think the kids should be fine for one night. I agree to your proposal of 3 water, 1 food and 1 firewood for me and 0 water 2 food and 2 wood for you.  How does that sound?",983,3
mturk_agent_2,Ok not sure if mymother inlaw can live with that but  I can so its a deal.,983,4
mturk_agent_1,Enjoy your stay!,983,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,983,5

mturk_agent_1,"Hi, Are you looking forward to camping?",984,0
mturk_agent_2,Yes I am very much so I definitely need a vacation.,984,0
mturk_agent_1,Me too. We have a big group going with us though so I'm not sure how relaxing it will be. ,984,1
mturk_agent_2,Well it's nice to go with other people lots of laughter and fun I'm sure.,984,1
mturk_agent_1,You're right. I'm expecting lots of good times. I'm not sure if I have enough food to feed them all though.,984,2
mturk_agent_2,Well I can negotiate 1 more package of food.  I'm sure you'd need more Firewood since you have a larger group.,984,2
mturk_agent_1,"Do you need water? I have lots of it that I can trade! What about if i get 2 food, 3 firewood and you get 1 food and 3 water? ",984,3
mturk_agent_2,I need food more than water.,984,3
mturk_agent_1,"okay so for me 1 food, 2 firewood, 2 water, for you 2 food, 1 fire, 1 water. I need mostly food but this works out pretty evenly i think",984,4
mturk_agent_2,Ok I can do that sounds look a good deal.,984,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,984,5
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,984,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello!,985,0
mturk_agent_1,hi there,985,0
mturk_agent_2,Looking forward to your camping trip?,985,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes. I need to trade with you some camping items.,985,1
mturk_agent_2,Yes definitely. I know I'm especially looking for food. We're camping for a couple weeks and we need to make sure to bring enough. What's your priority?,985,2
mturk_agent_1,I needed water and food also because I am diabetic. I often get thirsty and hungry a lot,985,2
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm. I would be willing to give you three packages of water, if I could have three packages of food. Maybe we could split up the firewood so we can both cook some food on our camping trip.",985,3
mturk_agent_1,How about I get two water for me and 1 for you? I give you 3 firewood,985,3
mturk_agent_2,I would be good with that if I could still have three packages of food. ,985,4
mturk_agent_1,I cant have no food at all or Ill die. How about two water for me and 1 for you? then 2 food for me and 1 for u? u get 3 firewood,985,4
mturk_agent_2,How about two food for me & 3 firewood and you can have all the water and 1 food. ,985,5
mturk_agent_1,"How about 2 water, 2 food and  2 firewood for me, then you get the rest?",985,5
mturk_agent_2,"Definitely not. Then you would have six items and I would have three, and I'm not getting enough food for my trip. What do you think of my offer of two food and three firewood for me, and 3 water and 1 food for you. That way you have enough food and water for your diabetic concerns. ",985,6
mturk_agent_1,Ill settle with 3 water and 2 food and then you can have have 1 food and 3 firewood. Im diabetic I need the water and food the most. You can just catch a fish during camping. I;m too old to catch any animal,985,6

mturk_agent_2,Reject-Deal,985,8
mturk_agent_2,"If I'm giving up what I need most, food, you're going to need to make up for it with allowing me to have more items overall. ",985,9
mturk_agent_1,I need them to survive. Final offer and Im walking away if you don't accept it.,985,9
mturk_agent_2,Walk-Away,985,10
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I was hoping to get 2 food and 2 firewood to make sure there's enough food and warmth for my kids. It's their first time camping. You can have the extra water since that's more useful after camping if it's not used up.",986,0
mturk_agent_1,"I have already got alot of water, I need food the most as I need it to survive",986,0
mturk_agent_2,"Well, we have enough food to survive. This is just extra.",986,1
mturk_agent_1,"ok, in that case can I get 3 food, 2 firewood and 0 water?",986,1
mturk_agent_2,What I'm saying is that we each should have enough of the basic stuff and the rest is extra.,986,2
mturk_agent_1,"ok, so lets split it in the middle, I will get 2 food, 1 firewood and 1 water, actually u are getting more as you will be getting 5 items",986,2
mturk_agent_2,Ok I'm fine with that. That's fair.,986,3
mturk_agent_1,ok,986,3
mturk_agent_2,"Just to confirm: 1 food for me, 2 firewood for me, and 2 waters for me. Correct?",986,4

mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,986,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,986,5
mturk_agent_2,"Hello, which item do you prefer the most?",987,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi, I prefer food.  I have to eat many times a day because of the meds I am on.  ",987,0
mturk_agent_2,"I need water the most as I need to be hydrated while camping, what is your second preference?",987,1
mturk_agent_1,"I agree about the water, but I would prefer firewood cuz I get cold easily. ☹️",987,1
mturk_agent_2,How do you think we should split them?,987,2
mturk_agent_1,I would prefer at least two food and two firewood and maybe one water?  What about you?,987,2
mturk_agent_2,I would be okay with 3 water and 1 firewood,987,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay, that sounds fair, so I get 3 food and 2 firewood?",987,3
mturk_agent_2,Unless you have another offer,987,4
mturk_agent_1,No I am good with that.   Thank you.,987,4
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,987,5
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,987,5
mturk_agent_2,Hello! So my son ended up bring an extra friend and you know how growing boys are lol I would love to have all the food and extra firewood. I would be willing to give up the water,988,0
mturk_agent_1,I cannot give up all the food. I am diabetic and have to worry about my blood sugar. I would be willing to give you 1 of the boxes of extra food and 2 of the firewood and 2 of the water.,988,0
mturk_agent_2,"Although, I sympathize with the condition. I won't have enough food and would be really needing the food more than the water. Can I maybe take 2 foods?",988,1
mturk_agent_1,"I really don't want to budge on the issue, if my blood sugar gets low I will desperately need the extra. In my experience camping, if I start having issues I need something on hand. Do y'all plan to fish or pick berries while camping? That could possibly supplement the extra food for the boys and it would give them a fun activity to do. 🙂",988,1
mturk_agent_2,Well that could be fun for you too. You have the basic supplies already so I would think that you just need a supplemental food 😮,988,2
mturk_agent_1,"You also have the basic supplies. I enjoy bird watching and just relaxing when I go camping. I am no longer able to hike or do much physical activity due to my health and age. I would prefer to have the food on hand. It could be a matter of life or death, especially since I camp on my own.☹️",988,2
mturk_agent_2,"I am going to be respectful and not argue here as they are the rules, you have an agreement. I will say you are comparing yourself to 3 people 😡",988,3
mturk_agent_1,"Thank you, I appreciate you being respectful of my health.",988,3
mturk_agent_2,"yup, so the agreement is 1 box food for myself, 2 firewood and 2 water. thank you",988,4

mturk_agent_2,Hello there. I,989,0
mturk_agent_1,Hello!,989,0
mturk_agent_2,I'm interested in making a deal with you on the packages.,989,1
mturk_agent_1,I think that I have some opinions about what might work best for me and be fair for us both. What is the most important to you out of the three items available?,989,1
mturk_agent_2,I need water the most. What do you prefer?,989,2
mturk_agent_1,"Water is also important to me, but I think that a large amount of firewood and food could also benefit me as well.",989,2
mturk_agent_2,I see. I don't need firewood that much. Would you like to take all of it so I can get more of the food and water?,989,3
mturk_agent_1,"I would still need a bit of food, but yes the firewood would help me",989,3
mturk_agent_2,🙂 Great! Take all the firewood then. Then I'll take a greater share of the food and water.,989,4
mturk_agent_1,"No, I will still need more food. ",989,4
mturk_agent_2,You drive a hard bargain. 😮,989,5

mturk_agent_1,"Hey there, I'm doing well! I'm excited to choose camping supplies.",99,0
mturk_agent_2,Me too🙂. I packed a lot of food so I have plenty to spare,99,1
mturk_agent_1,"that's awesome. I think I need more food myself, but I have tons of water.",99,1
mturk_agent_2,I really am in need of firewood and would appreciate the extra water if you can spare some,99,2
mturk_agent_1,"Would it be okay if I was to get 3 food packages, and spare you 3 water packages?",99,2
mturk_agent_2,That would be great 🙂. Would you be willing to take 1 firewood while I take 2?,99,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think that works, I am definitely down for that",99,3
mturk_agent_2,That is fantastic. ,99,4
mturk_agent_1,I'm glad negotiating feels smooth and clear,99,4
mturk_agent_2,"I know and out of all the other turkers I have negotiated with, you are by far the fastest.",99,5
mturk_agent_1,"Great, I'm going to input our agreed amounts.",99,5
mturk_agent_2,Submit-Deal,99,6
mturk_agent_1,Accept-Deal,99,6
mturk_agent_2,"Hey, So I'm really hoping to get some extra supplies, so how about 3 Water, 2 Firewood, and 1 Food package for me?",990,0
mturk_agent_1,"Well, I need water too. I propose i take 3 food, 2 water and 1 firewood.",990,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hmm, I'd really like at least 2 water, got any other offers?",990,1
mturk_agent_1,No i don't. I believe i presented the best offer.,990,1
mturk_agent_2,That's not too great for me. would you be willing to swap some food for firewood?,990,2
mturk_agent_1,Are you ready to give up the one food so that i can give up he 1 firewood for you?,990,2
mturk_agent_2,The offer you gave leaves me with no food currently.,990,3
mturk_agent_1,That is what i am saying. I can then take 2 food 2 water and 1 firewood. That is my best offer.,990,3
mturk_agent_2,"How about this. you get 3 Water, 0 Food, and 2 firewood. That leaves me with 0 Water, 3 Food, and 1 Firewood. Not perfect, but leaves us both equally unhappy 🙂",990,4
mturk_agent_1,No. I really need that food more than any thing else. Your first offer was better. I cannot give up food for anything.,990,4
mturk_agent_2,"Okay, I need water so, how about swapping, for me 3 water, 0 food and 1 firewood, for you 3 food, 0 water, and 2 firewood.",990,5

mturk_agent_2,Hello,991,0
mturk_agent_1,I have a large family and need a lot of food and water.,991,0
mturk_agent_2,What is your top priority? ,991,1
mturk_agent_1,I would like 3 food and 3 waters. You can have the firewood.🙂,991,1
mturk_agent_2,That is not fair. You can have 3 waters if I can have 3 food. ,991,2
mturk_agent_1,That isn't really fair either. Why do you need so much food?,991,2
mturk_agent_2,How is it not fair? It's three of each for both of us. You wanted 6 of the 9 items. I need the food because I am diabetic and low blood sugar can kill me.,991,3
mturk_agent_1,"☹️ I also need some food to feed my children. How about if I get two food, and two waters. That will give you one of each.",991,3
mturk_agent_2,"Absolutely not. How do you think that's fair? I'll take two food, two firewood and you can have the rest.",991,4
mturk_agent_1,I was only speaking of food and water. I hadn't discussed firewood. I really don't need any since it's so hot out. But with 5 children I'm not sure if one package of food will be enoguh.,991,4
mturk_agent_2,"I tried to be patient. My offer is 2 food, 2 firewood, and you can have the rest. That leaves you with 5 items and I only get 4. You can accept this, or I will walk away.",991,5
mturk_agent_1,😮,991,5
mturk_agent_2,"Do you agree? I will get 2 food, 2 firewood. You get 1 food, 1 firewood, and 3 water. ",991,6
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,991,6
mturk_agent_2,Accept-Deal,991,7
mturk_agent_1,"Dear friend. I am going camping and am in need of provisions. I am weary, but we must come to an agreement. I am requesting 3 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood. I know this is a big request, but the need is great. Would you be so kind as to accept this request?",992,0
mturk_agent_2,"Hi, I'm afraid I am also in dire need of them as well. I am open to negotiating, but will need a much fairer split than 3, 2, 2. I propose 2 food for myself, 3 firewood, and 1 water",992,0
mturk_agent_1,"You say fair, but that strikes me as a rather uneven split. What is your #1 need?",992,1
mturk_agent_2,"I need Food the most, and you?",992,1
mturk_agent_1,"I too need food most. If you have 2 food, that would leave me with only one of my most needed resource. I could possibly make this work, but then I would need 3 water and 2 firewood. ",992,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think the fairest would be a 5/4 split as there are 9 resources. Why don't you take 2 food and 2 water. I will take 1 food, 3 firewood, and 1 water? ",992,2
mturk_agent_1,"Yes, agree to the first point. What is your second most needed resource?",992,3
mturk_agent_2,"Firewood. I assume yours is water. Thus if you get 2 of each of your top 2, I'll need 1 and 3, with the tie break being 1 remaining of least desireable to make it fair",992,3
mturk_agent_1,"I think we can make that work. If you agree, let's submit the deal. I need to go to the doctor soon to get a boil lanced.",992,4
mturk_agent_2,"OK, sounds good. Feel free to submit it",992,4
mturk_agent_1,Submit-Deal,992,5

mturk_agent_2,Hello 🙂,993,0
mturk_agent_1,"Hi!  I would love to have as much firewood as possible, since I'll be going camping with my children, who I don't want to get cold at night.",993,0
mturk_agent_2,I totally understand that🙂. I would prefer to have extra water because I will also be camping with my 3 young kids and would like to make sure that we have enough.,993,1
mturk_agent_1,How much water will you be packing with you?,993,1
mturk_agent_2,I would like to have 2 of the extra packages of water if at all possible🙂,993,2
mturk_agent_1,Sure! 🙂 How are you with food?,993,2
mturk_agent_2,How much extra fire wood would you like?,993,3
mturk_agent_1,"If possible, I would be very appreciative to get all 3 🙂 If that doesn't work for you, I would also be happy with 2",993,3
mturk_agent_2,All was hoping for 2 of the food and 1 of the fire wood? Would that work for you?,993,4
mturk_agent_1,"Great! So then you would be getting 1 firewood, 2 water, and 2 food, right?",993,4
mturk_agent_2,That would be perfect.🙂Would that work for you?,993,5

mturk_agent_1,"Oh wow sounds good,  i like that too but it will be cold here soon",994,0
mturk_agent_2,"So you're going to want some firewood, right?  that's cool that's cool.  I only need a little to boil some water.",994,1
mturk_agent_1,Yes ill be needing firewood but my priority is food because I have a big family,994,1
mturk_agent_2,"Excellent I think we can work something out.  I'm trying to detox myself so I need as much water as I can get, but I'm also fasting for this detox.  So how about I take all the water, two of the firewood and you can have the rest.",994,2
mturk_agent_1,"How about if I get all the food, 2 firewood and 1 water?",994,2
mturk_agent_2,"I think I'm gonna need all the water, but I can bend a little on the firewood.  I can always look for more",994,3
mturk_agent_1,I'll give you all the water if I get all the food plus 2 of the firewood. What do you think?,994,3
mturk_agent_2,Yeah I think We can work that out.,994,4

mturk_agent_1,I'm doing well too,995,1
mturk_agent_2,Good to know. Would kindly wish to request to have additional items for the camping,995,1
mturk_agent_1,Not a problem. I can be fair. What are your preferences?,995,2
mturk_agent_2,"Additional food, firewood and water each by two",995,2
mturk_agent_1,"I was thinking we can make it a bit more equal and fair. Since I have three young children who have a condition where they get cold easily, I would like more firewood. How about 3 firewood packages for me and 1 food package. You can have 2 food packages and 3 water packages. How does that sound? 🙂",995,3
mturk_agent_2,Since you have small children that seems fair. i am open to your suggestion,995,3
mturk_agent_1,"Okay that sounds great, thank you so much for understanding. Do we both agree on 3 firewood and 1 food package for me, and 2 food and 3 water packages for you?",995,4
mturk_agent_2,Yes we have a deal,995,4

mturk_agent_1,Hi! How are you? I'm excited to be camping with my family. Maybe a bit too excited because I forgot to bring a few things 🙂,996,0
mturk_agent_2,I am fine.  How about you and family?  May I know what are the things you forget.,996,1
mturk_agent_1,Well I seem to have forgotten to pack firewood. My children will be so upset that they can't sing around the fire at night.  I also think that I underestimated how much food I brought.  Is there any way that you could spare some things?,996,1
mturk_agent_2,I can understand your situation.  I can also spare you some things and I also need you to compensate by sparing some other things that will make our trip to be excited.,996,2
mturk_agent_1,What are the kind of things that you need?,996,2
mturk_agent_2,"I thought that I will get woods in the camping area by cutting small branches of trees, but due to rain all trees are wet and it will not be used for firing.  ",996,3
mturk_agent_1,OK how about we share. If you could spare 2 wood for me you can keep 1. Also 2 foods for me and one for you.  I will not need too much water so you can have 2 and I will have one. How does that sound?,996,3
mturk_agent_2,Not that much good.  I can spare you all the foods as we have enough.  I need firewood in more numbers.,996,4
mturk_agent_1,"2 wood for you and 1 for me, 0 food for you and 3 for me and 1 water for me and 0 for you",996,4
mturk_agent_2,"I accepted with wood and food, but you mentioned that 1 water for you and 0 for me that how will be possible.  For me 2 water and 1 for you.",996,5
mturk_agent_1,I am sorry I mistyped.  I meant 2 water to water for me and 1 for you. Deal?,996,5

mturk_agent_2,"I'd like some firewood, too, and maybe a little water.",997,1
mturk_agent_1,I guess we are in the same boat.,997,1
mturk_agent_2,which items do you need?,997,2
mturk_agent_1,"Food is most important, I have to cook for the group",997,2
mturk_agent_2,"What if I give you one of the food and two of the water, and also a firewood?",997,3
mturk_agent_1,That's not bad,997,3
mturk_agent_2,That way we all get some of everything. ,997,4
mturk_agent_1,Well yes but if i am cooking the firewood is more important than the water,997,4
